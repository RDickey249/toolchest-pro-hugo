Docker is the containerization platform that revolutionized how applications are built, shipped, and deployed by packaging software and its dependencies into portable containers.

By solving the "it works on my machine" problem, Docker has become essential infrastructure for modern software development and deployment.

**How Docker changed everything:**
- **Consistent environments** - Applications run identically across development, testing, and production
- **Lightweight virtualization** - Containers share the OS kernel, using fewer resources than VMs
- **Rapid deployment** - Start applications in seconds, not minutes
- **Microservices enabler** - Perfect for breaking monoliths into smaller, manageable services

**Core concepts:**
- **Images** - Read-only templates containing application code and dependencies
- **Containers** - Running instances of images with isolated processes
- **Dockerfile** - Text files defining how to build images step-by-step
- **Registry** - Central repositories (like Docker Hub) for sharing images

**Key benefits:**
- **Developer productivity** - Consistent dev environments eliminate setup complexity
- **Deployment reliability** - What works locally works in production
- **Resource efficiency** - Run more applications on the same hardware
- **Scalability** - Easily scale applications up or down based on demand
- **Cloud portability** - Move applications between cloud providers seamlessly

**Perfect for:**
- **Developers** wanting consistent local development environments
- **DevOps teams** implementing CI/CD and infrastructure as code
- **Enterprises** modernizing legacy applications with microservices
- **Startups** needing rapid deployment and scaling capabilities

**Popular use cases:**
- Application modernization and migration to cloud
- Microservices architecture implementation
- CI/CD pipeline standardization
- Development environment standardization
- Legacy application containerization

**Docker ecosystem:**
- **Docker Desktop** - Local development environment
- **Docker Hub** - Public registry with millions of images
- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container application orchestration
- **Docker Swarm** - Native container orchestration

The technology that made "build once, run anywhere" a reality for applications.
