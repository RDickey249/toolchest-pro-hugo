# Monitoring & Observability

Monitoring and observability platforms provide the insights needed to maintain reliable, performant systems in production. These tools transform raw telemetry data into actionable intelligence that prevents outages and optimizes performance.

## Observability Pillars

- **Metrics**: Time-series data showing system and application performance trends
- **Logs**: Detailed records of system events and application behavior
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing showing request flows through microservices
- **Alerting**: Proactive notifications when issues or anomalies are detected
- **Dashboards**: Visual representations of system health and key performance indicators

Modern observability platforms combine these data sources to provide comprehensive visibility into complex distributed systems, enabling teams to understand system behavior and resolve issues quickly.
