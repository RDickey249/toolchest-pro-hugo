# NoSQL Databases

NoSQL databases emerged to address the limitations of traditional relational databases in handling web-scale applications, unstructured data, and rapid development cycles. These systems sacrifice some consistency guarantees for flexibility, scalability, and performance.

## Database Types

- **Document Databases**: Store data as flexible documents (JSON, BSON) with nested structures
- **Key-Value Stores**: Simple, high-performance storage for caching and session management
- **Wide-Column**: Scalable storage for time-series data and analytical workloads
- **Graph Databases**: Specialized for relationship-heavy data and network analysis
- **Time-Series**: Optimized for timestamp-based data and real-time monitoring

NoSQL databases excel in scenarios requiring rapid scaling, flexible schemas, or specialized data patterns that don't fit well into traditional relational models.
