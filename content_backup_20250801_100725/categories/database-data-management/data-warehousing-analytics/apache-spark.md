Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing that provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, along with an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs. Spark's in-memory computing capabilities deliver performance up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce for certain workloads by caching data across processing steps. The platform's unified approach handles batch processing, real-time streaming, machine learning, and graph processing within a single framework, reducing complexity and infrastructure requirements. Spark's resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) provide fault tolerance through lineage information, enabling automatic recovery from node failures without data loss. The platform's SQL engine, Spark SQL, provides distributed query execution with Catalyst optimizer that delivers near-interactive performance on large datasets. Spark Streaming processes real-time data streams with micro-batch processing, while Structured Streaming provides continuous processing with exactly-once semantics. MLlib, Spark's machine learning library, includes common algorithms and utilities for classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering. GraphX enables graph processing and analysis for applications like social network analysis and fraud detection. Spark's cluster managers support deployment on Hadoop YARN, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, and standalone modes, providing deployment flexibility. With extensive ecosystem integration and active open-source development, Spark has become the de facto standard for big data processing and analytics across industries.
