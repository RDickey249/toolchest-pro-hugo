- **Structured Schema**: Enforced data types and relationships prevent data corruption
- **SQL Standard**: Universal query language with extensive tooling and expertise
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Comprehensive backup, monitoring, and management tools
- **Proven Reliability**: Decades of optimization for mission-critical applications

Whether you're building e-commerce platforms, financial applications, or enterprise systems, relational databases provide the data integrity and query flexibility needed for complex business logic and reporting requirements.
