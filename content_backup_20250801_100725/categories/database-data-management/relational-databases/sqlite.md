SQLite is the world's most deployed database engine—a lightweight, serverless SQL database that requires zero configuration. Store your entire database in a single file, perfect for mobile apps, desktop software, and embedded systems.

## Key Benefits

**Zero Configuration**: No setup, no server, no administration—just start using it immediately.

**Single File Database**: Your entire database lives in one file that you can copy, move, or backup like any other file.

**Cross-Platform**: Works identically on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

**ACID Compliant**: Full transaction support ensures data integrity despite its simplicity.

**Battle-Tested**: Powers everything from web browsers to spacecraft—if reliability matters, SQLite delivers.

## Perfect For

Mobile apps (powers iOS Core Data and Android Room), desktop applications needing local storage, IoT devices, development environments, and any scenario where you need SQL capabilities without server complexity.
