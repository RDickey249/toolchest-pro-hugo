## How It Compares

Figma leads in collaborative design compared to prototyping-focused platforms like Framer or AI-assisted tools like Uizard. Unlike open-source alternatives like Penpot, Figma offers extensive plugin ecosystems and enterprise features. While specialized tools excel in single functions, Figma provides comprehensive design, prototyping, and collaboration in one platform. Compared to traditional design software, Figma eliminates file syncing issues and enables real-time teamwork. For product teams, UX/UI designers, and digital agencies who need comprehensive design capabilities with seamless collaboration and developer handoff features, Figma delivers the most complete and industry-standard design platform available.
