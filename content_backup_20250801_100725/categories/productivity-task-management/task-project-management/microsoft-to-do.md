Microsoft To Do is the task manager that just makes sense if you're already using Microsoft 365. Instead of juggling separate apps, everything syncs perfectly with Outlook, Teams, and your entire Microsoft workflow.

Built as the modern replacement for Wunderlist, Microsoft To Do brings clean design and powerful collaboration to the Microsoft ecosystem. Your Outlook tasks automatically appear in To Do, and tasks created in To Do sync back to Outlook - it's seamless integration done right.

**Why Microsoft users love To Do:**
- **Perfect Outlook sync** - Tasks flow seamlessly between Outlook and To Do

- Families sharing shopping lists and household tasks

## How It Compares

Microsoft To Do excels in the Microsoft ecosystem but doesn't try to be everything to everyone. While Todoist offers natural language processing and Remember The Milk provides power-user features, To Do focuses on simplicity and seamless integration. Compared to Google Tasks' basic functionality or Apple Reminders' iOS-centric approach, To Do provides better collaboration and cross-platform access. Unlike complex project management tools like Asana or ClickUp, To Do keeps task management straightforward while still offering essential collaboration features. For Microsoft 365 users wanting task management that just works with their existing tools, To Do is the obvious choice.
