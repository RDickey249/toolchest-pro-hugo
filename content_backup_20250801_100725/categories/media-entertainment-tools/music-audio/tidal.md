Tidal is a premium music streaming service that differentiates itself through high-fidelity audio quality and its focus on supporting artists through higher royalty payments. Co-owned by Jay-Z and other prominent musicians, Tidal emphasizes artist empowerment and exclusive content from major performers. The platform offers lossless CD-quality audio (FLAC) and Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) tracks that deliver studio-quality sound, appealing particularly to audiophiles and music enthusiasts with high-end audio equipment. Tidal's exclusive content includes early releases, behind-the-scenes footage, live performances, and original documentaries featuring world-class artists. The platform's editorial content, including articles, interviews, and music journalism, provides deeper context about artists and their work. Tidal's commitment to paying higher royalties to artists has attracted support from musicians and fans who want to ensure fair compensation for creators. With features like offline listening, curated playlists, and high-definition music videos, Tidal serves users who prioritize audio quality and artist support over the broader social features found in other streaming platforms.
