Amazon Music is Amazon's comprehensive streaming service offering multiple tiers from Prime Music (for Prime members) to the full-featured Amazon Music Unlimited with over 100 million songs. The platform provides high-definition and ultra-high-definition audio options for audiophiles seeking premium sound quality.

The service's deep integration with Alexa enables hands-free voice control, making it particularly powerful on Echo devices and throughout Amazon's smart home ecosystem.
