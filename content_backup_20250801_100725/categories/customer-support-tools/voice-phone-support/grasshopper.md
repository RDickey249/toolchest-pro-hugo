Grasshopper is a virtual phone system designed specifically for entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, and small businesses that want to project a professional image without the complexity of traditional business phone systems. The platform works with existing phones, forwarding calls to mobile devices or landlines while maintaining separation between personal and business communications. Grasshopper's key features include custom greetings, multiple extensions for different departments or team members, voicemail transcription, and business texting from dedicated numbers. The platform's mobile app allows users to make and receive calls using their business number, ensuring consistent caller ID for professional communications. With vanity and toll-free number options, businesses can choose memorable numbers that enhance their brand. Grasshopper includes features like call forwarding, simultaneous ring on multiple devices, and voicemail-to-email for staying connected on the go. The platform's simplicity extends to pricing with straightforward plans and no equipment requirements or installation fees. While lacking advanced call center features, Grasshopper excels at providing essential business phone functionality that's perfect for growing businesses not ready for complex phone systems.
