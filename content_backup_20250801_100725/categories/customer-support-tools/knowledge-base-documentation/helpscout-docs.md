Help Scout Docs is a beautifully simple knowledge base solution that helps businesses create helpful documentation without the complexity of traditional platforms. Part of the Help Scout customer support ecosystem, Docs seamlessly integrates with Help Scout's help desk, allowing support agents to insert knowledge base articles directly into conversations. The platform's clean, distraction-free editor makes writing and formatting articles intuitive, with support for images, videos, and code blocks. Help Scout Docs' Beacon widget can be embedded on any website, providing contextual help and search functionality without leaving the page. The platform includes powerful features like article recommendations based on page content, related articles suggestions, and contact forms that convert to support tickets when self-service isn't enough. With built-in analytics, teams can see which articles are most helpful and identify content gaps based on search queries. Help Scout Docs supports multiple collections for organizing different types of content, custom branding, and restricted access for internal documentation. Its focus on simplicity and integration makes it perfect for teams already using Help Scout or those seeking an uncomplicated documentation solution.
