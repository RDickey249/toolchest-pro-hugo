ReadMe is a developer-focused documentation platform that transforms API documentation from a necessary evil into a powerful developer experience tool. Purpose-built for technical documentation, ReadMe automatically generates interactive API references from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications while providing a rich authoring environment for guides and tutorials. The platform's standout feature is its interactive API explorer that allows developers to make live API calls directly from the documentation with personalized code examples in multiple programming languages. ReadMe's unique suggested edits feature enables community contributions while maintaining quality control through moderation workflows. The platform provides detailed analytics showing which endpoints are most used, what errors developers encounter, and where they struggle in the documentation. With features like versioning, changelogs, and automatic SDK generation, ReadMe helps API providers maintain documentation that evolves with their product. The platform's developer hub can be customized with themes, custom CSS, and JavaScript to match brand guidelines perfectly. ReadMe's focus on developer experience, combined with powerful collaboration features, makes it the preferred choice for API-first companies.
