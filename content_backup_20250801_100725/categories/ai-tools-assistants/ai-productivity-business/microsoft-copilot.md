## How It Compares

Microsoft Copilot differentiates itself through deep integration with Microsoft 365, unlike standalone tools like GrammarlyGO or general automation platforms like Zapier. While Notion AI enhances a specific workspace and IFTTT connects consumer services, Copilot transforms entire enterprise workflows. Unlike Bardeen's browser focus, Copilot works natively within desktop applications. Its enterprise features and security surpass consumer-focused alternatives, making it ideal for organizations prioritizing data protection. For businesses already using Microsoft 365, Copilot offers unmatched value by enhancing familiar tools rather than requiring new platform adoption, setting it apart from competitors in the enterprise AI assistant space.
