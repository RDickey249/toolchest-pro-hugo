## Why Privacy Advocates Choose Mullvad
Mullvad was built by privacy advocates for privacy advocates. They don't track users, don't store logs, and operate under Swedish privacy laws. The company has been subjected to police raids and proven they have no data to hand over - the ultimate privacy test.
