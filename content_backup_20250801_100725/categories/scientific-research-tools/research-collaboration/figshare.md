Figshare is a research data repository that allows researchers to upload, share, and cite datasets, figures, and other research outputs with permanent DOIs and open access visibility. The platform makes research data discoverable and citable, supporting the open science movement by providing a permanent home for research materials that might otherwise remain hidden or inaccessible.

The service bridges the gap between traditional publishing and data sharing, ensuring that valuable research outputs receive proper attribution while meeting funding agency requirements for data availability and reproducibility.

## What Makes Figshare Different

Figshare's open data approach includes:
- Immediate DOI assignment for all uploaded research outputs
