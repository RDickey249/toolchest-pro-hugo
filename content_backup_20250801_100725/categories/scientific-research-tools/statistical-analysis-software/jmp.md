JMP is a comprehensive statistical analysis software that emphasizes visual data exploration and interactive analysis. Developed by SAS Institute, JMP combines the power of advanced statistical methods with an intuitive graphical interface that makes complex analyses accessible through point-and-click interactions.

The software is particularly renowned for its dynamic visualizations and exploratory data analysis capabilities. JMP allows users to interact directly with data plots, making it easy to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships that might be missed in traditional tabular analysis.

## What Makes JMP Different

JMP's visual approach to statistical analysis includes:
- Interactive graphics that respond to user manipulation and selection
- Dynamic linking between data tables, graphs, and statistical output
- Visual data mining and exploration tools for pattern discovery
- Design of experiments (DOE) capabilities with graphical interfaces
- Statistical modeling with immediate visual feedback

Analysts and researchers choose JMP when they need to combine rigorous statistical analysis with intuitive visual exploration of complex datasets.
