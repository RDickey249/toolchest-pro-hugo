- **Mixins** - Reusable style patterns and functions
- **Partials** - Modular stylesheet organization
- **Two syntaxes** - Indented Sass and CSS-compatible SCSS
- **Built-in functions** - Color manipulation, math, and string operations
- **Control directives** - Conditional and loop constructs
- **Source maps** - Debugging support for compiled CSS

## Use Cases
