Clojure is a dynamic, functional Lisp language that runs on the JVM, emphasizing immutable data structures, powerful concurrency primitives, and elegant solutions to parallel programming challenges.

## Key Features

- **Functional programming** - Immutable data structures and functional approach
- **JVM compatibility** - Access to Java's vast ecosystem and performance
- **Homoiconic syntax** - Code as data enabling powerful metaprogramming
- **Concurrency primitives** - Software transactional memory and agents
- **REPL-driven development** - Interactive programming for rapid development
- **Persistent data structures** - Efficient immutable collections
- **Metaprogramming** - Macros and domain-specific language creation
- **Java interoperability** - Seamless integration with Java libraries

## Use Cases

- Data processing and transformation
- Financial systems and trading platforms
- High-concurrency applications
- Interactive development environments
- Functional programming projects
