Rust is a systems programming language that delivers memory safety without garbage collection through its ownership system, achieving safety, speed, and concurrency without compromising performance.

## Key Features

- **Memory safety** - Prevents null pointers, buffer overflows, and memory leaks
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - High-level features without runtime overhead
- **Ownership system** - Compile-time memory management without garbage collection
- **Concurrency** - Safe concurrent programming with data race prevention
- **Pattern matching** - Powerful control flow with match expressions
- **Trait system** - Flexible type system with zero-cost generics
- **Cargo package manager** - Built-in dependency management and build system
- **Excellent tooling** - Helpful compiler errors and comprehensive documentation

## Use Cases

- Systems programming and operating systems
- Web services and backend development
- Game engines and performance-critical applications
- Embedded systems and IoT devices
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency projects
