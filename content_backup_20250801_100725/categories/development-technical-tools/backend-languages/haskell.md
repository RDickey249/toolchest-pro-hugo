Haskell is a purely functional programming language with advanced type system and lazy evaluation that emphasizes mathematical precision, immutability, and compile-time correctness.

## Key Features

- **Purely functional** - Immutable data and pure functions by default
- **Advanced type system** - Powerful static typing with type inference
- **Lazy evaluation** - Computation happens only when results are needed
- **Monadic abstractions** - Elegant handling of effects and state
- **Pattern matching** - Powerful data structure deconstruction
- **Type classes** - Flexible polymorphism and abstraction
- **Strong ecosystem** - Libraries for parsing, concurrency, and web development
- **Compile-time safety** - Eliminates many runtime errors through static analysis

## Use Cases

- Financial systems requiring mathematical precision
- Compilers and language tools
- Research and academic applications
- Domain-specific language development
- Systems requiring high correctness guarantees
