Husky makes Git hooks simple and powerful. Automatically run linting, testing, and formatting on every commit to keep bad code out of your repository. It's the easiest way to enforce code quality standards across your entire team.

Used by projects like Vue.js, Create React App, and thousands of open source repositories, Husky ensures that code quality checks happen automatically - no more "oops, forgot to run the linter" commits.

## Key Features
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run linters, formatters, and tests before code gets committed
- **Pre-push Validation**: Execute comprehensive checks before pushing to remote
- **Commit Message Linting**: Enforce conventional commit standards automatically
- **Staged Files Only**: Run checks only on changed files for speed
- **Team Sync**: Share hook configurations so everyone follows the same rules
- **Tool Integration**: Works seamlessly with ESLint, Prettier, Jest, and more

## Why Teams Choose Husky
Husky eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem by running the same quality checks for everyone. New team members get automatic code quality enforcement from day one, and senior developers don't waste time reviewing code that should have been caught automatically.

## Perfect For
- Teams wanting to enforce code quality standards
- Projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, or Node.js
- Open source projects maintaining contribution standards
- Any repository where code quality matters

## Key Features

• **Pre-commit hooks** - Automatically run linting, formatting, and testing on staged files before commits are created
• **Pre-push validation** - Execute comprehensive tests and quality checks before code is pushed to remote repositories
• **Commit message enforcement** - Validate commit messages against conventional commit standards and custom formatting rules
• **Staged file processing** - Run quality checks only on modified files for faster feedback and efficient validation
• **Custom script execution** - Configure project-specific automation tasks and validation workflows through flexible hook configuration
• **Team standardization** - Share Git hook configurations across team members for consistent development practices
• **Tool integration** - Seamlessly integrate with ESLint, Prettier, Jest, TypeScript, and other development tools
• **Simple setup** - Easy installation and configuration with minimal setup requirements and automatic Git integration

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
• Excellent workflow automation providing seamless Git integration with automated quality checks and development standard enforcement
• Strong tool ecosystem offering integration with popular linting, formatting, and testing tools for comprehensive automation
• Good developer experience with simple setup, clear documentation, and minimal configuration requirements
• User-friendly team adoption encouraging consistent practices with shared configurations and standardized workflows
• Comprehensive validation capabilities supporting pre-commit, pre-push, and commit message validation for complete quality gates
• Regular updates with improvements, new features, and enhanced compatibility with modern development environments

### Cons
• Git dependency requiring teams to use Git version control, potentially limiting adoption in non-Git environments
• Performance impact on commit process potentially slowing development workflow with extensive quality checks and automation
• Configuration complexity for advanced setups requiring understanding of Git hooks and custom script development
• Platform limitations preventing hook execution in certain Git environments and hosting platforms
• Bypass potential allowing developers to skip hooks with Git flags, potentially undermining quality enforcement goals
