- **Development and testing** - Works identically in all environments
- **Dynamic responses** - Create realistic API behavior
- **Network simulation** - Test delays, errors, and timeouts
- **Framework agnostic** - Works with any JavaScript framework
- **Zero configuration** - Simple setup and intuitive API

## Use Cases

- Frontend API development
- Integration testing
- Offline development
- API prototyping
- Network error testing
