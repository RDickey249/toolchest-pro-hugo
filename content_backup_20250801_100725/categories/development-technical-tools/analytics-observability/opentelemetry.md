OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral, open-source framework that provides standardized APIs and tools for collecting telemetry data from applications and infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Vendor neutrality** - Avoid vendor lock-in with standardized telemetry
- **Multi-signal support** - Collect metrics, traces, and logs uniformly
- **Auto-instrumentation** - Automatic instrumentation for popular frameworks
- **CNCF project** - Cloud Native Computing Foundation incubated
- **Collectors** - Process and forward telemetry data with sampling
- **Semantic conventions** - Consistent data model across platforms
- **Exporter ecosystem** - Integrate with Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, and more
- **Language support** - SDKs for multiple programming languages

## Use Cases

- Cloud-native application observability
- Microservices monitoring
- Distributed tracing
- Vendor-neutral telemetry collection
- Multi-platform observability
