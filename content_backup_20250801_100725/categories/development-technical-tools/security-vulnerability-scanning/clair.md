Clair is the open-source container security scanner that detects vulnerabilities in container images through layer-by-layer static analysis. Integrate with container registries and CI/CD pipelines to secure containerized applications before deployment.

Used by organizations running Kubernetes and container platforms, Clair scans container images against CVE databases, Red Hat Security Data, and Ubuntu Security Notices. Identify security vulnerabilities in OS packages and dependencies with API-driven architecture and enterprise scalability.
