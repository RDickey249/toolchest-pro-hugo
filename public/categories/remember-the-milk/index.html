Its Smart Lists feature is unmatched - neither Microsoft To Do nor Any.do can match its flexibility. Compared to modern apps like Things 3 or TickTick, RTM may look dated but delivers superior functionality for complex workflows. Unlike simpler tools that prioritize design over features, RTM serves users who need deep organizational capabilities and aren&rsquo;t afraid of a learning curve.
