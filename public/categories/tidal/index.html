Co-owned by Jay-Z and other prominent musicians, Tidal emphasizes artist empowerment and exclusive content from major performers. The platform offers lossless CD-quality audio (FLAC) and Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) tracks that deliver studio-quality sound, appealing particularly to audiophiles and music enthusiasts with high-end audio equipment.
