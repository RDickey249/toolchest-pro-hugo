<span class=subcategory-badge>Music & Audio</span></div><h1>Bandcamp</h1><p class=tool-tagline>Direct-to-fan platform supporting independent musicians</p></header><div class=tool-content><p>Bandcamp is a revolutionary platform that connects independent musicians directly with their fans, emphasizing fair compensation and artistic independence. Unlike traditional streaming services, Bandcamp allows artists to set their own prices and keep the majority of revenue from sales, with fans able to pay more than the asking price to show additional support. The platform serves as both a discovery tool for music lovers seeking unique, independent content and a powerful sales and marketing platform for artists. Bandcamp&rsquo;s high-quality audio downloads include multiple formats from MP3 to FLAC, appealing to both casual listeners and audiophiles. The platform&rsquo;s fan funding features enable supporters to become patrons of their favorite artists, providing ongoing financial support for creative projects. Bandcamp Fridays, where the platform waives its fees, have become significant events in the independent music community, driving substantial revenue to artists. The platform&rsquo;s editorial content and discovery features help fans find new music while supporting independent artists financially. With its focus on album-oriented listening and comprehensive liner notes, Bandcamp preserves the traditional album experience in the digital age while fostering direct artist-fan relationships.</p><h2 id=get-started-with-bandcamp>Get Started with Bandcamp</h2><p>Ready to get started?
