<span class=subcategory-badge>Code Quality & Linting</span></div><h1>TSLint</h1><p class=tool-tagline>Deprecated TypeScript linter (historical reference)</p></header><div class=tool-content><p>TSLint served as the pioneering static analysis tool specifically designed for TypeScript code quality and style enforcement, providing comprehensive linting capabilities that helped establish coding standards and best practices in the early TypeScript ecosystem before its official deprecation in favor of ESLint&rsquo;s improved TypeScript support through @typescript-eslint/parser and related plugins. This foundational tool excelled at detecting TypeScript-specific issues including type-related problems, interface consistency, and language feature usage while offering extensive rule customization that enabled teams to enforce consistent coding standards across TypeScript projects, complemented by integration with popular editors and build tools that provided real-time feedback during development. TSLint&rsquo;s historical significance lies in its role as the first mature linting solution for TypeScript development, establishing patterns and practices that influenced the broader TypeScript community while providing essential tooling during TypeScript&rsquo;s rapid growth and adoption, though its rule system and plugin architecture were eventually superseded by ESLint&rsquo;s more flexible and performant approach. The platform&rsquo;s legacy continues to influence modern TypeScript development practices, as many of its rules and concepts were migrated to ESLint configurations, while its deprecation represents the natural evolution of tooling ecosystems toward more unified and maintainable solutions that serve multiple languages and frameworks. Understanding TSLint remains valuable for maintaining legacy codebases and appreciating the historical development of TypeScript tooling, while its transition to ESLint demonstrates the importance of community-driven tool evolution and the benefits of consolidating around proven, extensible platforms.</p><h2 id=get-started-with-tslint>Get Started with TSLint</h2><p>Note: TSLint is deprecated.
