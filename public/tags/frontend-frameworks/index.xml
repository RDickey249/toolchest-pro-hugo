      <description>Angular is Google&amp;rsquo;s enterprise-grade framework for building large-scale web applications. With its comprehensive tooling, TypeScript-first approach, and opinionated architecture, it&amp;rsquo;s the go-to choice for teams building complex, maintainable applications.&#xA;Unlike lighter frameworks, Angular provides everything out of the box - routing, forms, HTTP client, testing utilities, and more. This &amp;ldquo;batteries included&amp;rdquo; philosophy makes it ideal for enterprise teams who need consistency and don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time choosing and integrating libraries.</description>
