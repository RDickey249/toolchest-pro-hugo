# A/B Testing & Optimization

A/B testing and optimization platforms enable teams to make data-driven decisions about user experience improvements through scientific experimentation and behavioral analysis.

## Optimization Features

- **Experiment Design**: Create controlled tests comparing different variations of pages or features
- **Statistical Analysis**: Ensure results are statistically significant before making decisions
- **User Segmentation**: Target specific user groups with personalized experiences
- **Multivariate Testing**: Test multiple variables simultaneously for complex optimization
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Understand how users interact with different variations

These platforms transform guesswork into scientific optimization, enabling teams to continuously improve conversion rates, user engagement, and business metrics through data-driven experimentation.
