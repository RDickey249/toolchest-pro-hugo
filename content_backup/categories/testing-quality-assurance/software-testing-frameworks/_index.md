These tools enable developers to write and execute unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests that validate application functionality and prevent regressions. From JavaScript testing frameworks to browser automation tools, these platforms support test-driven development and continuous integration workflows."

# Software Testing Frameworks

Software testing frameworks are the backbone of quality assurance in modern development, enabling automated testing that scales with application complexity while maintaining rapid development cycles.

## Testing Types

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Validate interactions between different parts of the application
- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete user workflows across the entire application
- **Browser Testing**: Automate testing across different browsers and devices
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality

Modern testing frameworks provide rich assertion libraries, mocking capabilities, and detailed reporting that make it easier to write maintainable tests and identify issues quickly.
