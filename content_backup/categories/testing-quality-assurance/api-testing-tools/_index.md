# API Testing Tools

API testing tools are essential for validating the reliability, performance, and security of web services and APIs that power modern applications. These platforms make API testing accessible to both technical and non-technical team members.

## Testing Capabilities

- **Request Building**: Create and customize HTTP requests with headers, parameters, and body data
- **Response Validation**: Verify status codes, response structure, and data integrity
- **Authentication**: Support for various auth methods including OAuth, JWT, and API keys
- **Environment Management**: Switch between development, staging, and production configurations
- **Automated Testing**: Create test suites that run automatically in CI/CD pipelines

Whether you're testing simple REST APIs or complex GraphQL schemas, these tools provide the functionality needed to ensure your APIs work correctly and consistently.
