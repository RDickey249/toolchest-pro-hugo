# Cloud Platforms

Cloud platforms have transformed how organizations build and deploy applications, providing scalable infrastructure without the complexity of managing physical hardware. These services enable rapid innovation and global reach through pay-as-you-scale models.

## Platform Capabilities

- **Compute Services**: Virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions for running applications
- **Storage Solutions**: Object storage, block storage, and file systems with global replication
- **Networking**: Virtual networks, load balancers, and content delivery networks
- **Managed Databases**: Relational and NoSQL databases with automatic scaling and backup
- **Global Infrastructure**: Data centers worldwide for low-latency access and disaster recovery

Whether you're deploying a simple web application or building complex distributed systems, cloud platforms provide the building blocks and managed services needed to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure management.
