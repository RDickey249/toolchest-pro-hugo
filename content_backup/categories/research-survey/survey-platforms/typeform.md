Typeform revolutionizes online forms and surveys with a conversational approach that feels more like a dialogue than a questionnaire. By presenting one question at a time in a visually appealing format, Typeform creates engaging experiences that significantly increase completion rates compared to traditional surveys. The platform's design-first philosophy means every form looks professional and works beautifully on any device without any design skills required. Typeform's powerful features include conditional logic, hidden fields, calculation capabilities, and payment collection through Stripe integration. The platform excels at creating interactive experiences with features like opinion scales, ratings, and picture choices that make responding enjoyable. With VideoAsk integration, users can add video questions for more personal touch. Typeform's analytics dashboard provides insights into completion rates, drop-off points, and response patterns. The platform integrates with over 500 apps through native integrations and Zapier, enabling automated workflows. From lead generation forms to customer feedback surveys and job applications, Typeform transforms any data collection need into an engaging conversation that people actually want to complete.
