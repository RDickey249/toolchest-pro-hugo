C is the foundational systems programming language that provides minimal runtime overhead, direct hardware access, and serves as the foundation for operating systems and embedded systems.

## Key Features

- **Manual memory management** - Complete control over memory allocation
- **Direct hardware access** - Low-level system programming capabilities
- **Minimal runtime** - No garbage collection or hidden overhead
- **Portable** - Runs on virtually all computing platforms
- **Simple syntax** - Straightforward procedural programming model
- **Pointer arithmetic** - Direct memory manipulation capabilities
- **Standard library** - Comprehensive system and I/O functions
- **Predictable performance** - Deterministic execution characteristics

## Use Cases

- Operating system kernels
- Embedded systems and microcontrollers
- Device drivers and system software
- Performance-critical applications
- Real-time systems
