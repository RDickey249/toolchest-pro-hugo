# Anchore

Anchore revolutionizes container security and compliance through its comprehensive policy-based platform that provides deep container image analysis, vulnerability assessment, and policy enforcement capabilities that enable organizations to implement robust container security governance across their entire container lifecycle from development to production deployment. This enterprise-grade platform excels at comprehensive container inspection through its detailed analysis engine that examines container contents, software packages, configuration files, and metadata while applying customizable security and compliance policies that can enforce organizational standards, regulatory requirements, and security best practices automatically throughout container deployment workflows. Anchore's strength lies in its policy engine and enterprise integration capabilities, offering sophisticated policy management that enables teams to define custom rules for vulnerability thresholds, package whitelisting, configuration compliance, and licensing requirements, while its integration with CI/CD pipelines, container registries, and orchestration platforms ensures that security and compliance checks are enforced consistently across all container deployments. The platform dominates enterprise container environments where its combination of detailed analysis, flexible policy management, and comprehensive reporting makes it essential for organizations that need to maintain strict security and compliance standards while scaling container adoption, particularly in regulated industries that require detailed audit trails and compliance documentation, while its commercial support and enterprise features provide the reliability and scalability needed for mission-critical container infrastructure that must meet stringent security, compliance, and operational requirements.
