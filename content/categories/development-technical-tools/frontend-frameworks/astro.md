Astro is the web framework that lets you use React, Vue, Svelte, and others together while shipping zero JavaScript by default. It's the perfect solution for content sites that need maximum performance without framework lock-in.

Built around the "islands architecture," Astro generates static HTML and only adds JavaScript where you specifically need interactivity. This results in sites that load instantly and score perfect performance audits.

## What Makes Astro Special
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML in the same project
- **Zero JS by Default**: Ships pure HTML/CSS unless you opt into JavaScript
- **Island Architecture**: Add interactivity only where needed with selective hydration
- **Content First**: Built for blogs, marketing sites, and documentation
- **Automatic Optimization**: Image processing, CSS bundling, and code splitting included
- **TypeScript Ready**: Full TypeScript support with zero configuration

## Perfect For
- Content-heavy sites (blogs, marketing, documentation)
- Teams using multiple frontend frameworks
- Projects that prioritize performance over interactivity
- Developers migrating from Jekyll, Hugo, or other static generators

## Why Developers Choose Astro
Astro solves the "framework wars" by letting you use whatever you want. Need a React component library? Use it. Prefer Vue for forms? No problem. Want a Svelte animation? Go for it. Everything renders to fast, static HTML.

## Key Features

â€¢ **Multi-framework component support** - Integration with React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks within single projects
â€¢ **Island architecture pattern** - Selective hydration enabling interactive components only where needed for optimal performance
â€¢ **Zero JavaScript by default** - Static-first approach with minimal JavaScript delivery for blazing-fast loading speeds
â€¢ **Content-first optimization** - Built-in markdown and MDX support with automatic content processing and optimization
â€¢ **Automatic performance optimization** - Image optimization, CSS bundling, and code splitting without configuration requirements
â€¢ **TypeScript zero-config** - First-class TypeScript support with automatic setup and type checking capabilities
â€¢ **Flexible deployment options** - Support for static hosting, serverless functions, and edge deployment platforms
â€¢ **Component library compatibility** - Seamless integration with existing component libraries and design systems

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
â€¢ Excellent performance characteristics providing minimal JavaScript footprint and fast loading through island architecture
â€¢ Strong framework flexibility offering multi-framework support without vendor lock-in or migration complexity
â€¢ Good developer experience supporting familiar component patterns with enhanced performance optimization capabilities
â€¢ User-friendly content authoring encouraging adoption with markdown and MDX support for content creators
â€¢ Comprehensive optimization features improving user experience through automatic performance enhancements
â€¢ Regular updates with focus on performance improvement and framework ecosystem compatibility

### Cons
â€¢ Learning curve for island architecture requiring understanding of selective hydration and component interaction patterns
â€¢ Limited interactivity by default potentially requiring careful planning for dynamic user interface requirements
