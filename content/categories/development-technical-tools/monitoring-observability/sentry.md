# Sentry

Sentry helps developers ship better software faster by tracking errors and performance issues in real-time. When your application crashes or slows down, Sentry tells you exactly what went wrong, where it happened, and who was affected.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Error Tracking**: Catch errors as they happen with full stack traces
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track slow transactions and identify bottlenecks
- **Release Tracking**: See which deployment introduced issues
- **Smart Alerts**: Get notified about critical errors, not noise
- **User Impact**: Know exactly how many users are affected
- **Multi-platform**: Supports 100+ languages and frameworks

## Why Teams Choose Sentry
Sentry provides context that logs can't - showing the exact line of code, user actions, and environment that led to each error. The platform automatically groups similar errors, prioritizes by impact, and integrates with your existing workflow tools.
