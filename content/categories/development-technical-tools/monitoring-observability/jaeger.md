Jaeger is an open-source distributed tracing system that helps you monitor and troubleshoot complex microservices architectures. See exactly how requests flow through your services, identify performance bottlenecks, and debug issues across distributed systems.

## Key Features

**Distributed Tracing**: Track requests as they travel through multiple microservices, showing timing, dependencies, and error paths.

**Service Maps**: Visualize your entire service architecture and understand how components interact.

**Performance Analysis**: Identify slow services, optimize response times, and monitor system health over time.

**Low Overhead**: Efficient instrumentation with configurable sampling rates that won't impact your application performance.

**Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-ready with support for service meshes like Istio and integration with popular observability platforms.

## Perfect For

DevOps teams running microservices who need visibility into complex distributed systems. Whether you're debugging intermittent issues, optimizing performance, or understanding service dependencies, Jaeger provides the insights you need.
