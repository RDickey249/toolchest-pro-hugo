# npm

npm revolutionizes JavaScript package management through comprehensive registry services and dependency management that enable developers to install, share, and manage JavaScript packages with automated dependency resolution, version control, and global package distribution. This package manager provides extensive features for package installation, script running, dependency management, and publishing while offering advanced capabilities like workspaces, security auditing, and team collaboration tools. npm's strength lies in its ecosystem size and integration, offering access to the world's largest software registry with over one million packages and seamless Node.js integration. The platform excels at serving JavaScript developers, Node.js applications, frontend projects, and web development teams requiring dependency management with features like semantic versioning, lockfile generation, and automated security updates that enable everything from simple script management to complex application builds with package scripts, development workflows, and team collaboration while providing developers with comprehensive package discovery, version management, and publishing capabilities that support the entire JavaScript ecosystem.
