Assembly language provides the closest programming interface to computer hardware with direct control over CPU instructions, memory, and processor registers.

## Key Features

- **Direct hardware control** - Manipulate CPU instructions and registers directly
- **Maximum performance** - Achieve optimal execution speed and efficiency
- **Architecture-specific** - Varies by processor (x86, ARM, RISC-V)
- **No abstraction layer** - Direct mapping to machine code
- **Precise memory control** - Exact memory address manipulation
- **Instruction-level optimization** - Control every CPU operation
- **Hardware feature access** - Use specific processor capabilities
- **Minimal overhead** - No runtime or compiler abstractions

## Use Cases

- Embedded systems and microcontrollers
- Operating system kernel development
- Performance-critical optimizations
- Cryptographic implementations
- Reverse engineering and security research
