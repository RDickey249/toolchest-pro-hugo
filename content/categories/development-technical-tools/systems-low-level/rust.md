Rust is a modern systems programming language that emphasizes memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and fearless concurrency without sacrificing performance.

## Key Features

- **Memory safety** - Prevents null pointers, buffer overflows, and memory leaks
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - High-level features without runtime overhead
- **Ownership system** - Unique approach to memory management
- **Fearless concurrency** - Safe concurrent programming with Send/Sync traits
- **Pattern matching** - Powerful control flow with match expressions
- **Trait system** - Flexible and powerful type system
- **Cargo package manager** - Modern build system and dependency management
- **Cross-platform** - Runs on many architectures and operating systems

## Use Cases

- Systems programming and operating systems
- Web backends and APIs
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency projects
- Game engines and performance-critical applications
- Command-line tools and utilities
