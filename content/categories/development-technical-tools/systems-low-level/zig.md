Zig is a next-generation systems programming language that addresses C's shortcomings while maintaining simplicity and performance with improved safety and debugging.

## Key Features

- **Manual memory management** - No hidden control flow or garbage collection
- **Compile-time execution** - Run code at compile time for metaprogramming
- **Cross-compilation** - Exceptional support for multiple architectures
- **C interoperability** - Seamless integration with C libraries
- **Optional types** - Null safety without overhead
- **Explicit error handling** - No exceptions, clear error propagation
- **Built-in testing** - Integrated testing framework
- **No undefined behavior** - Catch issues at compile time

## Use Cases

- Systems programming and operating systems
- Embedded systems development
- Performance-critical applications
- Game development and engines
- Modernizing C codebases
