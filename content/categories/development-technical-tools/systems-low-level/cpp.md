C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language that extends C with object-oriented features, templates, and modern constructs for high-performance applications.

## Key Features

- **Object-oriented programming** - Classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
- **Template metaprogramming** - Compile-time code generation
- **Zero-overhead abstractions** - High-level features without runtime cost
- **RAII** - Deterministic resource management
- **Standard Template Library** - Rich collection of algorithms and containers
- **Multiple paradigms** - Procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming
- **Manual memory management** - Direct control over memory allocation
- **Cross-platform** - Runs on many operating systems and architectures

## Use Cases

- Game engines and AAA game development
- High-frequency trading systems
- Browser engines and databases
- Operating systems and device drivers
- Real-time and embedded systems
