Gulp is a streaming build system and task runner that automates development tasks using JavaScript code with efficient pipe-based processing.

## Key Features

- **Streaming builds** - Process files as streams for better performance
- **Code over configuration** - Write tasks in JavaScript rather than config files
- **Pipe-based architecture** - Chain transformations efficiently
- **Plugin ecosystem** - Extensive collection of plugins for any task
- **File watching** - Automatic task execution on file changes
- **Source maps** - Debug processed files with original source mapping
- **Incremental builds** - Process only changed files for speed
- **Flexible tasks** - Use functions, conditionals, and loops in tasks

## Use Cases

- Frontend build automation
- Asset compilation and optimization
- CSS preprocessing and minification
- JavaScript transpilation and bundling
- Development workflow automation
