# Gitea

Gitea delivers self-hosted Git service excellence through its lightweight, efficient platform that provides comprehensive Git repository hosting with minimal resource requirements, making it ideal for individuals, small teams, and organizations that need full control over their code hosting infrastructure without the complexity and overhead of larger enterprise solutions. This streamlined platform offers essential collaboration features including pull requests, issue tracking, project boards, and wiki functionality while maintaining a clean, intuitive interface that focuses on core Git operations and team collaboration without unnecessary complexity or resource consumption. Gitea's strength lies in its simplicity and efficiency, providing a complete Git hosting solution that can run on modest hardware while offering features comparable to much larger platforms, including support for multiple authentication methods, organization management, webhook integrations, and comprehensive API access that enables custom workflows and integrations. The platform excels in environments where data sovereignty, cost control, and simplicity are priorities, offering easy installation through single binary deployment, Docker containers, or package managers, while its active open-source community ensures continuous development and security updates without vendor lock-in concerns. Gitea's design philosophy emphasizes practical functionality over feature bloat, making it an excellent choice for teams that need reliable Git hosting with collaboration features but prefer to maintain control over their infrastructure, data, and costs while benefiting from a solution that scales efficiently from personal use to supporting hundreds of users and repositories with minimal administrative overhead.
