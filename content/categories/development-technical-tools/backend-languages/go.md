- **Fast compilation** - Sub-second build times with single binary output
- **Garbage collection** - Automatic memory management without manual allocation
- **Strong standard library** - Networking, cryptography, and web server support
- **Cross-compilation** - Build for multiple platforms from single codebase
- **Built-in tooling** - Formatting, testing, and benchmarking included
- **Static typing** - Compile-time error checking with type safety

## Use Cases

- Microservices and distributed systems
- Cloud infrastructure and DevOps tools
- Web servers and REST APIs
