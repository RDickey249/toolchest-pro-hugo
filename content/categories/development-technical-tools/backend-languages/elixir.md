Elixir is a dynamic, functional programming language built on the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM) that enables fault-tolerant, distributed systems with massive concurrency and automatic recovery capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Erlang VM foundation** - Built on battle-tested telecommunications infrastructure
- **Massive concurrency** - Handle millions of lightweight processes efficiently
- **Fault tolerance** - Automatic process recovery and error isolation
- **Functional programming** - Immutable data structures and pattern matching
- **Actor model** - Intuitive concurrent programming with message passing
- **Hot code swapping** - Update code without stopping the system
- **Phoenix framework** - Modern web framework with LiveView and real-time features
- **Distributed systems** - Built-in support for multi-node deployments

## Use Cases

- Real-time web applications and chat systems
- IoT and distributed sensor networks
- High-availability systems and telecom applications
- Concurrent data processing pipelines
- Fault-tolerant microservices
