# Lua

Lua revolutionizes embedded scripting through lightweight design and extensibility that enable developers to embed scripting capabilities into applications, games, and systems with minimal memory footprint, simple C API integration, and flexible programming paradigms while maintaining high performance and ease of integration. This interpreted language provides extensive features for first-class functions, coroutines, dynamic typing, and metaprogramming while offering advanced capabilities like userdata types, garbage collection, and comprehensive standard library. Lua's strength lies in its simplicity and embeddability, offering a small, fast scripting language that integrates seamlessly into existing applications and systems. The platform excels at serving game developers, embedded systems, configuration scripting, and applications requiring extensible scripting with features like lightweight virtual machine, simple syntax, and excellent C integration that enable everything from game scripting to application configuration with minimal overhead, flexible programming models, and reliable performance while providing developers with simple yet powerful language features, comprehensive documentation, and proven track record in demanding applications that make Lua ideal for scenarios requiring embedded scripting capabilities.
