Scala is a hybrid programming language that combines functional and object-oriented paradigms on the JVM, powering big data frameworks like Apache Spark and Kafka with expressive, high-performance code.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid paradigm** - Combines functional and object-oriented programming
- **JVM compatibility** - Access to Java ecosystem and libraries
- **Advanced type system** - Higher-kinded types and pattern matching
- **Big data powerhouse** - Powers Apache Spark, Kafka, and distributed systems
- **Concurrency** - Actor model with Akka framework
- **Immutable data structures** - Functional programming with safe concurrency
- **Expressive syntax** - Concise code with powerful abstractions
- **High performance** - Compiled to JVM bytecode for speed

## Use Cases

- Big data processing and analytics
- Distributed computing systems
- Financial trading platforms
- Enterprise backend services
- Real-time data streaming
