Husky makes Git hooks simple and powerful. Automatically run linting, testing, and formatting on every commit to keep bad code out of your repository. It's the easiest way to enforce code quality standards across your entire team.

Used by projects like Vue.js, Create React App, and thousands of open source repositories, Husky ensures that code quality checks happen automatically - no more "oops, forgot to run the linter" commits.

## Key Features
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run linters, formatters, and tests before code gets committed
- **Pre-push Validation**: Execute comprehensive checks before pushing to remote
- **Commit Message Linting**: Enforce conventional commit standards automatically
- **Staged Files Only**: Run checks only on changed files for speed
- **Team Sync**: Share hook configurations so everyone follows the same rules
- **Tool Integration**: Works seamlessly with ESLint, Prettier, Jest, and more

## Why Teams Choose Husky
Husky eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem by running the same quality checks for everyone. New team members get automatic code quality enforcement from day one, and senior developers don't waste time reviewing code that should have been caught automatically.

## Perfect For
- Teams wanting to enforce code quality standards
- Projects using JavaScript, TypeScript, or Node.js
- Open source projects maintaining contribution standards
- Any repository where code quality matters
