# Obsidian

Obsidian transforms personal knowledge management through its unique approach to note-taking that treats information as an interconnected web of ideas, using bidirectional linking and graph visualization to reveal hidden connections between concepts while maintaining full ownership of your data through local markdown files. This powerful knowledge management system enables users to build a "second brain" by creating atomic notes that link to each other, forming a rich network of knowledge that can be explored through multiple views including the revolutionary graph view that visualizes relationships between ideas as an interactive network diagram. Obsidian's extensibility through community plugins provides virtually unlimited customization possibilities, from advanced query systems and spaced repetition learning to integration with external tools and custom workflows, while its core features include powerful search, tag systems, templates, and real-time preview that enhance the markdown editing experience. The platform excels for researchers, writers, students, and knowledge workers who need to manage complex information relationships and discover new insights through connected thinking, with its local-first approach ensuring data ownership and privacy while enabling synchronization across devices through Obsidian Sync, making it ideal for building personal wikis, research databases, writing projects, and any scenario where understanding connections between ideas is as important as the ideas themselves.
