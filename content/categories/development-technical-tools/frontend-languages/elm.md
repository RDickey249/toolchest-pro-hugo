Elm is a purely functional programming language for reliable web applications that guarantees no runtime exceptions through its strong type system and functional programming principles.

## Key Features

- **No runtime exceptions** - Strong type system eliminates runtime crashes
- **Functional programming** - Immutable data and pure functions by design
- **Helpful compiler** - Clear, friendly error messages for faster debugging
- **Time-traveling debugger** - Step through application state changes
- **Automatic optimization** - Built-in performance optimizations and small bundles
- **Enforced semantic versioning** - Prevents breaking changes in packages
- **The Elm Architecture** - Predictable state management pattern
- **Excellent refactoring** - Type system enables fearless code changes

## Use Cases

- Reliable web applications requiring zero crashes
- Complex user interfaces with predictable state
- Long-term maintainable frontend projects
- Teams prioritizing code quality and reliability
- Applications requiring extensive refactoring
