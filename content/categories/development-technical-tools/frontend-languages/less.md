# LESS

LESS brings dynamic capabilities to CSS through a leaner, more intuitive preprocessor that extends stylesheets with variables, mixins, operations, and functions while maintaining a syntax so close to CSS that any valid CSS file is also valid LESS, making adoption seamless for teams looking to enhance their styling workflow. This JavaScript-based CSS preprocessor distinguishes itself with the ability to run both server-side via Node.js and client-side directly in the browser during development, providing unprecedented flexibility for rapid prototyping and live stylesheet updates without complex build processes. LESS's approach to CSS enhancement focuses on simplicity and pragmatism, offering powerful features like lazy-loaded variables, guarded mixins for conditional styling, namespacing for organization, and JavaScript evaluation for dynamic calculations while keeping the learning curve gentle for CSS developers. The preprocessor excels at progressive enhancement of existing projects, allowing teams to gradually adopt advanced features while maintaining backward compatibility, making it particularly attractive for projects that need to modernize their styling architecture without a complete rewrite or for developers who want the benefits of a CSS preprocessor without the overhead of complex tooling and compilation steps.
