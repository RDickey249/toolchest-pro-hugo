# Jupyter

Jupyter transforms data science and research through its interactive computing environment that seamlessly blends executable code, rich visualizations, and narrative text into shareable documents called notebooks, revolutionizing how scientists, researchers, and data practitioners explore data, prototype algorithms, and communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. This browser-based platform supports over 40 programming languages through its kernel architecture, with Python, R, and Julia being the most popular, while enabling real-time collaboration, version control integration, and deployment to cloud platforms that make reproducible research and data analysis accessible to teams of any size. Jupyter's ecosystem includes JupyterLab for advanced development workflows, JupyterHub for multi-user deployments, and extensions that add functionality like variable inspection, code formatting, and integration with databases and cloud services, while supporting rich media output including interactive plots, maps, and widgets that bring data to life. The platform dominates machine learning research, data science education, and exploratory data analysis where its ability to combine code experimentation with immediate visual feedback accelerates the discovery process, enabling practitioners to iterate rapidly on hypotheses, share insights through compelling visualizations, and maintain detailed documentation of analytical workflows that ensure reproducibility and enable knowledge transfer across teams and organizations working with complex data and computational models.
