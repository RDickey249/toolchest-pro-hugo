# SQLite

SQLite stands as the world's most deployed database engine, providing a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database that requires zero configuration and operates as a single file, making it ideal for embedded systems, mobile applications, desktop software, and any scenario where simplicity and reliability are paramount. This file-based database implements most of the SQL standard while maintaining an incredibly small footprint (under 1MB), with ACID compliance ensuring data integrity despite its simplicity, and cross-platform compatibility that works identically across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android systems. SQLite's architecture eliminates the complexity of client-server databases by storing the entire database in a single disk file that can be copied, moved, or backed up like any other file, while supporting concurrent read access and providing performance that often exceeds client-server databases for read-heavy workloads and moderate write loads. The database excels in applications requiring embedded data storage, including mobile apps where it powers both iOS Core Data and Android Room persistence libraries, desktop applications needing local data storage, IoT devices with limited resources, and development environments where ease of setup and deployment matter more than maximum concurrency, with its battle-tested reliability making it the foundation for countless applications ranging from web browsers and operating systems to aerospace systems and military hardware.
