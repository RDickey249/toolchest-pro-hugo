- **Storage orchestration** - Persistent volume management
- **Secret management** - Secure configuration and credential handling
- **Extensible architecture** - Rich ecosystem of operators and tools

## Use Cases

- Microservices orchestration
- Cloud-native application deployment
- Container cluster management
- DevOps and CI/CD pipelines
- Multi-cloud and hybrid deployments
