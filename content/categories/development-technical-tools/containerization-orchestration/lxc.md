# LXC

LXC revolutionizes system-level virtualization through lightweight container technology and comprehensive process isolation that enable administrators to run multiple Linux systems on single hosts with near-native performance, complete system environments, and efficient resource utilization while maintaining security isolation and operational flexibility. This containerization technology provides extensive features for system containers, resource management, networking configuration, and storage handling while offering advanced capabilities like live migration, snapshot management, and comprehensive security profiles. LXC's strength lies in its system-level approach and performance efficiency, offering operating system-level virtualization that provides complete Linux environments with minimal overhead compared to traditional hypervisor-based virtualization. The platform excels at serving system administrators requiring efficient virtualization, development environments needing isolated systems, and hosting providers seeking resource optimization with features like cgroup integration, namespace isolation, and comprehensive management tools that enable everything from development sandboxes to production hosting with system-level isolation, resource control, and operational efficiency while providing administrators with comprehensive configuration options, management utilities, and proven stability that makes system containerization reliable and efficient for diverse use cases requiring complete system environments.
