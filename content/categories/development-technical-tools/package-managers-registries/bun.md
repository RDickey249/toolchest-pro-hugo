# Bun

Bun revolutionizes JavaScript development through comprehensive all-in-one runtime and blazing-fast performance that enable developers to run, bundle, test, and manage JavaScript applications with significantly improved speed, built-in TypeScript support, and extensive Node.js compatibility while maintaining zero-configuration setup and comprehensive toolchain integration. This JavaScript runtime platform provides extensive features for package management, bundling, testing, and script execution while offering advanced capabilities like native TypeScript compilation, SQLite integration, and comprehensive web API support. Bun's strength lies in its performance optimization and unified approach, offering developers complete JavaScript toolchain that dramatically reduces startup times and build processes while delivering the modern features and compatibility needed for strategic JavaScript development and comprehensive project coordination through cutting-edge runtime technology. The platform excels at serving modern JavaScript developers requiring fast development cycles, Node.js projects needing performance optimization, full-stack applications seeking unified tooling, and teams requiring consolidated JavaScript infrastructure that combines runtime execution with strategic build optimization and comprehensive package management across web applications, servers, and development workflows. Its performance-focused feature set includes comprehensive JavaScript runtime with significantly faster startup and execution compared to Node.js, built-in package manager with npm compatibility and faster installation speeds, native bundler with zero-configuration setup and optimized output generation, integrated test runner with Jest-compatible API and improved performance, TypeScript support without additional configuration or compilation steps, SQLite database integration with native performance and simple API access, Web API compatibility with modern browser standards and comprehensive polyfills, and comprehensive JavaScript intelligence that transforms development workflows from multi-tool complexity into strategic runtime intelligence that drives both development velocity and application performance through unified coordination and comprehensive optimization support.
