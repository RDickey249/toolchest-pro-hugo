# Insomnia

Insomnia is the fast, beautiful API client that makes testing REST and GraphQL APIs a pleasure. Built by Kong, it combines a clean interface with powerful features that developers actually use.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Beautiful Interface**: Clean, intuitive design that doesn't get in your way\n- **Environment Variables**: Switch between dev, staging, and production instantly\n- **GraphQL Support**: First-class GraphQL with schema fetching and autocomplete\n- **Request Collections**: Organize APIs into workspaces and folders\n- **Code Generation**: Generate code snippets in 12+ languages\n- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with custom plugins\n\n## Why Developers Choose Insomnia\nInsomnia hits the sweet spot between simplicity and power. It's faster than Postman, prettier than curl, and has just the right features without the bloat. The environment management is particularly elegant, making it easy to test the same API across different deployments.\n\n## Get Started with Insomnia\n\n<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">\n  <a href="https://insomnia.rest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: inline-block; background: #96BF47; color: white; padding: 1rem 2rem; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-right: 1rem;">Visit Insomnia →</a>\n  <a href="https://insomnia.rest/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="display: inline-block; background: #007cba; color: white; padding: 1rem 2rem; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1rem;">Download Free →</a>\n</div>
