HashiCorp Vault secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys. It's the secrets management solution trusted by enterprises to protect their most sensitive data.

From startups to Fortune 500 companies, Vault eliminates secrets sprawl by centralizing all sensitive data in a single, secure location with fine-grained access controls and comprehensive audit trails.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Generate secrets on-demand with automatic expiration
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit with key rotation
- **Identity-Based Access**: Fine-grained policies control who can access what
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all secrets access and operations
- **Multi-Cloud Ready**: Works across AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises
- **API First**: Programmatic access for automation and integration

## Why Security Teams Choose Vault
Vault eliminates the security risks of hardcoded passwords and scattered API keys. Instead of storing secrets in config files or environment variables, applications retrieve them securely from Vault with automatic rotation and revocation. The zero-trust approach ensures even if systems are compromised, secrets remain protected.
