# Burp Suite

Burp Suite stands as the industry-leading web application security testing platform, combining advanced vulnerability detection with sophisticated manual testing capabilities through its integrated suite of tools that enable security professionals to perform comprehensive assessments of web applications, APIs, and mobile backends with unmatched depth and accuracy. This professional-grade platform centers around its intercepting proxy that captures and manipulates HTTP/HTTPS traffic, complemented by automated scanners that detect hundreds of vulnerability types, an intuitive repeater for manual request crafting, an intruder for automated attacks, and advanced features like session handling, macro recording, and custom extensions that adapt to complex authentication schemes and business logic flaws. Burp Suite's intelligent scanning engine goes beyond basic vulnerability detection by understanding application context, following complex multi-step processes, and identifying logic flaws that automated tools typically miss, while its collaborative features enable security teams to share findings, track remediation progress, and maintain detailed engagement records. The platform dominates enterprise security testing and penetration testing engagements where its combination of automation and manual testing capabilities, extensive customization options, and professional reporting features make it essential for identifying critical vulnerabilities in complex web applications, while its active community, regular updates, and comprehensive training resources ensure security professionals can leverage cutting-edge techniques to protect organizations against evolving web application threats and compliance requirements.
