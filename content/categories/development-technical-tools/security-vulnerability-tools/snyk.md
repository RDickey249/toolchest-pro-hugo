Snyk makes security a natural part of development by finding and fixing vulnerabilities directly in developer workflows. Instead of security being a gate at the end, Snyk identifies issues as you code and suggests fixes automatically.

Trusted by over 2.6 million developers at companies like Google, Salesforce, and ASOS, Snyk scans code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure for vulnerabilities while providing actionable remediation guidance.

## Key Features
- **Code Scanning**: Find vulnerabilities in your application code as you write it
- **Dependency Scanning**: Monitor open source libraries for known security issues
- **Container Security**: Scan Docker images and Kubernetes configurations
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Check Terraform, CloudFormation, and ARM templates
- **Automated Fixes**: Generate pull requests with security patches
- **IDE Integration**: Security feedback directly in VS Code, IntelliJ, and other editors

## Why Developers Choose Snyk
Snyk shifts security left without slowing down development. Developers get security insights when they can act on them most effectively - while coding. The platform's smart prioritization focuses attention on the vulnerabilities that actually matter, not just the highest severity scores.
