# Snyk

Snyk revolutionizes application security by seamlessly integrating vulnerability detection and remediation directly into developer workflows, providing real-time scanning of open source dependencies, container images, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations, and application code while offering automated fix suggestions and pull requests that enable teams to address security issues without disrupting development velocity. This developer-centric platform transforms security from a bottleneck into an enabler by embedding vulnerability scanning throughout the software development lifecycle, from IDE plugins and CLI tools to CI/CD pipeline integration and production monitoring, while maintaining an extensive vulnerability database that covers millions of packages across JavaScript, Python, Java, .NET, Go, Ruby, PHP, and other ecosystems. Snyk's intelligent prioritization system focuses developer attention on the vulnerabilities that matter most by considering exploitability, reachability analysis, and business context, while its automated remediation capabilities generate precise fix pull requests that upgrade vulnerable dependencies to secure versions or apply patches when upgrades aren't available. The platform excels in modern DevSecOps environments where security needs to scale with rapid development cycles, offering comprehensive coverage across the entire application stack including open source libraries, first-party code, container configurations, and cloud infrastructure templates, while its seamless integration with popular development tools, version control systems, and deployment platforms ensures that security becomes a natural part of the development process rather than an afterthought, enabling organizations to ship secure software faster while maintaining the agility and innovation speed that modern businesses demand.
