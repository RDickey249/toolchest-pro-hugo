# OWASP ZAP

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) empowers developers and security professionals with comprehensive web application security testing through its open-source platform that automatically detects vulnerabilities while providing manual testing capabilities for thorough security assessments during development and production phases. This powerful proxy tool intercepts and inspects HTTP/HTTPS traffic between browsers and web applications, enabling both automated vulnerability scanning and manual penetration testing with features like active scanning, passive scanning, and fuzzing that identify common security flaws including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication bypasses. ZAP's integrated approach combines automated detection with manual verification tools, offering detailed vulnerability reports, proof-of-concept demonstrations, and remediation guidance that help development teams understand and fix security issues efficiently while supporting integration with CI/CD pipelines through its API and command-line interface. The platform excels in DevSecOps environments where security testing needs to be embedded throughout the development lifecycle, providing both desktop GUI applications for security analysts and headless automation for continuous integration workflows that enable teams to shift security left, catch vulnerabilities early, and maintain secure coding practices while benefiting from the extensive OWASP community's contributions, regular updates, and comprehensive documentation that make enterprise-grade security testing accessible to organizations of any size.
