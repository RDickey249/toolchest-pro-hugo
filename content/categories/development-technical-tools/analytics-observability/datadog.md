# Datadog

Datadog delivers comprehensive observability across modern cloud environments through its unified platform that seamlessly integrates infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring (APM), log management, and security monitoring into a single pane of glass, enabling organizations to maintain visibility and control over complex, distributed systems while accelerating troubleshooting and optimization efforts. This enterprise-grade platform excels at correlating data across the three pillars of observability—metrics, traces, and logs—through its sophisticated data collection agents and integrations with 700+ technologies, providing real-time insights into application performance, infrastructure health, user experience, and business metrics while supporting everything from traditional servers to serverless functions and containerized workloads. Datadog's intelligent alerting system combines machine learning-powered anomaly detection with customizable thresholds and forecasting capabilities, while its collaborative features like incident management, dashboard sharing, and automated runbooks enable teams to respond to issues quickly and learn from incidents to prevent future problems. The platform dominates enterprise observability requirements where its combination of ease of deployment, powerful analytics capabilities, and comprehensive coverage makes it essential for maintaining service reliability, optimizing performance, and ensuring security compliance across multi-cloud and hybrid environments, while its extensive API ecosystem, custom metrics support, and integration with CI/CD pipelines enable teams to embed observability throughout their development and operations workflows.
