# OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry revolutionizes observability through its vendor-neutral, open-source framework that provides standardized APIs, SDKs, and tools for collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data—including metrics, traces, and logs—from applications and infrastructure, enabling organizations to achieve comprehensive observability without vendor lock-in while supporting seamless integration with multiple monitoring and analytics platforms. This cloud-native project, incubated by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), empowers developers to instrument their applications once and export telemetry data to any compatible backend, supporting automatic instrumentation for popular frameworks and languages alongside manual instrumentation for custom applications, while its consistent data model and semantic conventions ensure that telemetry data remains portable and meaningful across different tools and environments. OpenTelemetry's flexible architecture includes collectors that can receive, process, and forward telemetry data with advanced features like sampling, filtering, and enrichment, while its extensive ecosystem of exporters supports integration with observability platforms like Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, and commercial solutions, complemented by robust community contributions and enterprise backing from major technology companies. The platform excels in modern cloud-native environments where its standardized approach to observability enables teams to avoid vendor lock-in, reduce instrumentation complexity, and future-proof their monitoring investments, while its support for distributed tracing, custom metrics, and structured logging provides the foundation for understanding complex, microservices-based applications and ensuring reliable, performant systems that meet both technical and business requirements.
