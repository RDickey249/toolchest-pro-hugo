# GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects delivers code-integrated planning capabilities that seamlessly connect project management with software development workflows. This native GitHub feature enables teams to create project boards, track issues, and manage tasks directly within their code repositories. The platform offers kanban-style boards, customizable fields, and automated workflows that respond to code changes and pull requests. Development teams benefit from automatic issue tracking, milestone management, and progress visualization. GitHub Projects excels at maintaining alignment between project planning and actual code development, providing transparency into development progress. The tool integrates perfectly with GitHub's ecosystem, including Actions, Issues, and Pull Requests, making it essential for teams practicing continuous integration and deployment while requiring detailed project visibility.
