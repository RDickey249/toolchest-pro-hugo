The platform excels at serving software development teams building web applications, mobile apps, and digital products, product managers coordinating feature releases, and startups needing lightweight but powerful project management tools that scale with team growth. Its integration with popular development tools, automatic progress tracking, and intuitive interface create a seamless workflow that connects project planning with actual code development, ensuring that project management enhances rather than hinders development velocity.
