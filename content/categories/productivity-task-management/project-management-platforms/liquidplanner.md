LiquidPlanner is the project management tool that finally makes project schedules realistic. Instead of fixed deadlines that everyone knows are wrong, LiquidPlanner uses intelligent scheduling that adapts to reality - accounting for priorities, interruptions, and resource constraints.

Trusted by companies like Fitbit, Zynga, and Plantronics, LiquidPlanner solves the biggest problem in project management: schedules that break the moment something changes. Its priority-driven approach means projects get done in the right order, on time.

## What Makes LiquidPlanner Different
- **Smart Scheduling**: Automatically calculates realistic timelines based on priorities and capacity
- **Ranged Estimates**: Use best/worst case estimates instead of impossible precision
- **Priority-Based Planning**: Work on what matters most, automatically
- **Resource Optimization**: Balance workloads across team members
- **Predictive Analytics**: See project health and delivery predictions in real-time
- **Portfolio Management**: Coordinate multiple projects with shared resources

## Perfect For
- Professional services firms juggling client projects
- Software teams managing feature releases
- Creative agencies balancing multiple campaigns
- Any team tired of missed deadlines and overcommitted schedules
