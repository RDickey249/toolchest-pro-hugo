# Chartio

Chartio empowers teams to explore data through intuitive visual queries, transforming complex databases into accessible insights without requiring SQL expertise. Business users can drag and drop to build sophisticated analytics, while data teams maintain governance and security.

The platform connects to virtually any data source - from cloud databases like Snowflake and BigQuery to business applications like Salesforce and HubSpot. Smart suggestions help users discover relevant data relationships, while automatic joins eliminate technical barriers to cross-functional analysis.

Key capabilities include real-time collaborative dashboards, embedded analytics for customer-facing applications, and advanced features like custom calculations and SQL mode for power users. Teams can share insights through interactive dashboards, scheduled reports, and data stories that drive decision-making across the organization.

Chartio particularly excels for growing companies that need self-service analytics without overwhelming technical overhead. The visual query interface democratizes data access while maintaining the depth needed for complex business analysis.
