While conversion tools like ConvertCart emphasize customer behavior, Lily AI prioritizes product intelligence and search improvement. Compared to manual cataloging approaches, Lily AI offers unprecedented scale and consistency. For fashion retailers, home goods stores, and e-commerce businesses with large product catalogs who need detailed, accurate product data to power superior search and personalization experiences, Lily AI delivers the most advanced product intelligence platform available.
