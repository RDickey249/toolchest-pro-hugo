Sisu transforms business metrics monitoring into intelligent diagnostic insights by automatically analyzing performance changes, identifying root causes, and surfacing the specific factors driving business outcomes, eliminating the endless manual investigation that typically follows unexpected metric shifts. This sophisticated analytics platform specializes in answering the critical "why" questions that arise when key performance indicators change, using advanced statistical methods and machine learning to pinpoint the exact segments, cohorts, or dimensions responsible for metric variations. Sisu's strength lies in its ability to continuously monitor thousands of business metrics and instantly decompose any significant change into its contributing factors, enabling data teams and business leaders to understand performance drivers rather than just observe results. The platform excels at helping organizations move beyond simple dashboards to gain deeper understanding of their business mechanics, automatically flagging anomalies and providing detailed explanations that guide strategic decisions. Whether you're investigating a sudden drop in conversion rates, understanding why revenue increased in specific regions, or analyzing customer behavior changes across different segments, Sisu provides the diagnostic intelligence that turns metric monitoring into actionable business understanding. Its focus on causal analysis and automated investigation makes it invaluable for organizations that need to quickly understand and respond to changing business conditions.

## How It Compares

Sisu specializes in diagnostic analytics and root cause analysis, contrasting with predictive platforms like Obviously AI or general exploration tools like Polymer. While MonkeyLearn focuses on text analysis and Yurbi provides traditional BI, Sisu excels at understanding why metrics change. Unlike visualization platforms like Tellius or forecasting tools like Pecan, Sisu prioritizes automated investigation and anomaly explanation. Compared to enterprise solutions like TIBCO Spotfire, Sisu offers more specialized diagnostic capabilities with less manual analysis required. For organizations that need to quickly understand the drivers behind metric changes and business performance shifts, Sisu provides unmatched automated diagnostic intelligence that traditional analytics tools cannot deliver.
