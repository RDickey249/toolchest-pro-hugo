Krisp is an AI-powered noise cancellation tool that eliminates background noise, echo, and distractions in real-time during calls and recordings. It works with any communication app including Zoom, Teams, Discord, and recording software to deliver crystal-clear audio regardless of your environment.

What makes Krisp powerful is its real-time processing that distinguishes between human voice and environmental noise, preserving natural speech while removing everything from barking dogs to construction sounds. Unlike post-production tools, Krisp works invisibly in the background without requiring location changes or setup.

## How It Compares

Krisp specializes in real-time noise cancellation, distinguishing it from post-production tools like Cleanvoice or Adobe Podcast. While Descript focuses on comprehensive editing and Auphonic handles complete audio processing, Krisp excels during live recording and calls. Unlike voice generation platforms like Resemble.ai or reading apps like Speechify, Krisp enhances existing audio input. Compared to content creation tools like Listnr, Krisp solves immediate recording quality problems. For users needing instant audio improvement during recording or calls rather than post-production enhancement, Krisp provides unmatched real-time performance that transforms any space into a professional recording environment.
