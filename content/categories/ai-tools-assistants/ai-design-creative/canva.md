## How It Compares

Canva occupies a unique position between pure AI generators like DALL·E and Midjourney and professional tools like Adobe Firefly. While Stable Diffusion focuses on generation and Runway on video, Canva provides a complete design ecosystem. Unlike Microsoft Designer's template focus, Canva offers broader functionality including AI generation, video editing, and collaboration. Its strength lies in accessibility—where other tools require expertise or focus on single functions, Canva provides an all-in-one solution. For users needing quick, professional results without learning complex software, Canva's template-driven approach with AI enhancement offers the best balance of capability and ease of use.
