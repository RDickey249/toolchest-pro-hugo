## How It Compares

Dialogflow represents the enterprise standard for conversational AI, offering advanced NLU capabilities that surpass simpler platforms like Chatfuel, Tidio, or Botsify. While ManyChat focuses on marketing automation and Drift specializes in sales, Dialogflow provides foundational AI technology for any use case. Unlike visual-first platforms like Landbot or Flow XO, Dialogflow emphasizes advanced AI and enterprise scalability. Compared to open-source solutions like Botpress, Dialogflow offers managed AI services with Google's infrastructure backing.
