## How It Compares

Botpress targets developers and enterprises needing maximum customization, contrasting with user-friendly platforms like Tidio or Botsify that prioritize simplicity. While ManyChat and Chatfuel offer marketing-focused features and Drift specializes in sales automation, Botpress provides foundational technology for any use case. Unlike SaaS solutions like Flow XO or Landbot, Botpress offers complete platform ownership and modification rights. Compared to enterprise platforms like Dialogflow, Botpress provides open-source flexibility without cloud dependencies. For organizations requiring custom chatbot solutions, complete data control, and maximum flexibility, Botpress offers capabilities that closed-source platforms cannot match, though it requires significant technical investment.
