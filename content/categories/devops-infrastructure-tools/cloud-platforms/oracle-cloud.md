# Oracle Cloud

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is an enterprise-grade cloud platform built from the ground up with a focus on high performance, security, and cost-effectiveness, particularly for database and enterprise application workloads. The platform's autonomous database services represent a breakthrough in self-managing, self-securing, and self-repairing database technology that eliminates routine maintenance tasks. OCI's bare metal and virtual machine instances provide exceptional performance for demanding workloads, while its networking architecture delivers consistent, predictable performance. The platform's unique pricing model includes no data egress fees and performance-based compute pricing that can significantly reduce costs compared to other cloud providers. Oracle Cloud's comprehensive security model includes isolated network virtualization, encryption by default, and compartment-based access controls. The platform's integration with Oracle's extensive software portfolio, including enterprise applications, middleware, and databases, provides seamless migration paths for existing Oracle customers. OCI's high-performance computing capabilities support complex simulations, machine learning, and analytics workloads that require massive computational resources. The platform's disaster recovery and backup services ensure business continuity for mission-critical applications. Oracle Cloud's global infrastructure continues to expand with data centers designed for high availability and low latency. With services spanning compute, storage, networking, databases, analytics, and AI, Oracle Cloud provides a complete platform optimized for enterprise workloads and Oracle software environments.
