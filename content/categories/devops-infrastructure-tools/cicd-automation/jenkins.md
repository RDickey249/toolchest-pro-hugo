# Jenkins

Jenkins is the world's leading open-source automation server that enables continuous integration and continuous deployment for software development teams. The platform's extensible architecture supports over 1,800 plugins that integrate with virtually every tool in the DevOps ecosystem, from version control systems to deployment platforms. Jenkins' pipeline-as-code approach allows teams to define build, test, and deployment workflows using Groovy scripts stored alongside application code. The platform's distributed build capabilities enable master-agent architectures that scale build capacity across multiple machines and environments. Jenkins' trigger system supports various activation methods including code commits, scheduled builds, and external API calls for flexible automation workflows. The platform's robust reporting features track build history, test results, and deployment metrics with customizable dashboards and notifications. Jenkins' security model includes user authentication, authorization, and audit logging that meets enterprise compliance requirements. The platform's backup and disaster recovery capabilities ensure build configurations and history are protected. Jenkins' integration with containerization technologies enables ephemeral build agents and consistent build environments. The platform's Blue Ocean interface provides modern, visual pipeline creation and monitoring capabilities. With its large community, extensive documentation, and enterprise support options, Jenkins remains the most widely adopted CI/CD platform for organizations seeking flexible, powerful automation capabilities.
