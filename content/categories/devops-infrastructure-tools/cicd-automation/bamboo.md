# Bamboo

Bamboo is Atlassian's continuous integration and deployment server that provides seamless integration with other Atlassian tools including Jira, Bitbucket, and Confluence for comprehensive development workflow automation. The platform's plan and job structure enables complex build configurations with parallel execution, conditional logic, and dependency management. Bamboo's deployment projects separate build and deployment concerns, enabling consistent artifact promotion across development, staging, and production environments. The platform's elastic agents provide on-demand build capacity through Amazon EC2, reducing infrastructure costs while ensuring build availability. Bamboo's branch workflow support includes automatic plan creation for feature branches and integration with Bitbucket's pull request workflows. The platform's comprehensive permissions system provides role-based access control for projects, plans, and deployment environments with integration to enterprise directory services. Bamboo's reporting and analytics features track build performance, deployment frequency, and success rates with customizable dashboards and notifications. The platform's REST API enables integration with custom tools and automated workflow management. Bamboo's artifact management includes dependency resolution, release management, and integration with artifact repositories like Nexus and Artifactory. The platform's built-in Docker support simplifies containerized build environments and deployment workflows. While Atlassian has shifted focus to cloud-based solutions, Bamboo continues to serve organizations heavily invested in Atlassian's on-premises ecosystem seeking tight integration between development and deployment tools.
