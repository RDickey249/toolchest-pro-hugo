# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a native CI/CD platform that provides seamless integration with GitHub repositories, enabling automated workflows triggered by repository events like code pushes, pull requests, and issue creation. The platform's workflow syntax uses YAML files stored in the repository, ensuring version control and collaboration on automation processes. GitHub Actions' marketplace offers thousands of pre-built actions for common tasks like testing, deployment, and notifications, accelerating workflow development. The platform's matrix builds enable testing across multiple operating systems, language versions, and configurations simultaneously. GitHub Actions' secrets management provides secure storage and injection of sensitive information like API keys and deployment credentials. The platform's self-hosted runners allow organizations to use their own infrastructure for builds while maintaining integration with GitHub's workflow system. GitHub Actions' comprehensive event system triggers workflows based on repository activity, external webhooks, and scheduled intervals. The platform's artifact system enables sharing of build outputs, test results, and deployments between workflow steps and jobs. GitHub Actions' integration with GitHub's security features includes dependency scanning, code scanning, and secret scanning within CI/CD pipelines. The platform's generous free tier and per-minute pricing for private repositories make it cost-effective for projects of all sizes. With its tight GitHub integration and growing ecosystem, GitHub Actions has become the preferred CI/CD solution for open-source projects and GitHub-centric development workflows.
