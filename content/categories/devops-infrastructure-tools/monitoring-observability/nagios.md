# Nagios

Nagios is a proven, enterprise-grade monitoring system that provides comprehensive monitoring of IT infrastructure including servers, networks, applications, and services. The platform's plugin-based architecture supports thousands of community and commercial plugins for monitoring virtually any component or service in IT environments. Nagios' host and service monitoring capabilities track availability, performance metrics, and health status with customizable check intervals and retry logic. The platform's notification system provides escalation paths, dependency handling, and flexible routing to ensure critical issues reach the right personnel. Nagios' event handling system can automatically execute corrective actions when problems are detected, enabling self-healing infrastructure capabilities. The platform's web interface provides status overviews, historical reporting, and configuration management through both core and enhanced commercial interfaces. Nagios' distributed monitoring capabilities enable hierarchical architectures that scale monitoring across multiple data centers and network segments. The platform's configuration system uses text files that can be version controlled and automated, supporting infrastructure-as-code practices. Nagios' extensive logging and reporting capabilities provide audit trails, trend analysis, and compliance reporting for enterprise requirements. The platform's high availability features include redundancy, failover, and load distribution for mission-critical monitoring environments. While newer platforms offer modern interfaces and cloud-native features, Nagios remains widely adopted for its reliability, extensive plugin ecosystem, and proven track record in enterprise environments requiring comprehensive infrastructure monitoring.
