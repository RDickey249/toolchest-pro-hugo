# Zabbix

Zabbix is an enterprise-class open-source monitoring solution that provides comprehensive monitoring of networks, servers, cloud services, applications, and business metrics through a unified platform. The platform's agent-based and agentless monitoring capabilities collect performance data from diverse sources including SNMP, IPMI, JMX, and custom scripts. Zabbix's template system enables consistent monitoring configuration across similar devices and applications with inheritance and mass deployment capabilities. The platform's trigger system provides flexible alerting with mathematical expressions, logical operators, and time-based conditions for accurate problem detection. Zabbix's visualization capabilities include real-time graphs, network maps, screens, and dashboards that provide operational insights and executive-level reporting. The platform's distributed monitoring architecture supports proxy servers that enable monitoring across WAN links and isolated network segments while reducing bandwidth usage. Zabbix's auto-discovery features automatically detect and begin monitoring new network devices, services, and applications based on configurable rules. The platform's escalation system provides sophisticated notification workflows with time delays, condition checks, and multiple communication channels. Zabbix's web-based interface provides configuration management, real-time monitoring, and historical analysis through an intuitive, customizable dashboard. The platform's API enables automation, third-party integrations, and custom application development for specialized monitoring requirements. With its comprehensive feature set, scalability to hundreds of thousands of devices, and enterprise-grade reliability, Zabbix serves organizations requiring robust, cost-effective monitoring solutions without licensing restrictions.
