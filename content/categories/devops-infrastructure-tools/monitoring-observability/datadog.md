# Datadog

Datadog is a comprehensive monitoring and analytics platform that provides unified visibility across applications, infrastructure, and logs through a single dashboard. The platform's infrastructure monitoring covers servers, containers, databases, and cloud services with over 600 built-in integrations for popular technologies and services. Datadog's application performance monitoring (APM) provides automatic instrumentation for multiple programming languages with distributed tracing, code-level insights, and deployment tracking. The platform's log management capabilities aggregate, search, and analyze log data from any source with real-time parsing and correlation with metrics and traces. Datadog's network performance monitoring provides visibility into network traffic, DNS resolution, and load balancer performance across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. The platform's synthetic monitoring proactively tests applications and APIs from global locations to identify performance issues before users are affected. Datadog's real user monitoring (RUM) tracks actual user experiences including page load times, user journeys, and frontend errors. The platform's security monitoring detects threats and compliance violations through log analysis, file integrity monitoring, and anomaly detection. Datadog's machine learning capabilities automatically detect anomalies, forecast capacity needs, and provide intelligent alerting to reduce notification fatigue. The platform's extensive API and integration ecosystem enables custom dashboards, automated responses, and workflow integration. With its focus on unified observability and actionable insights, Datadog helps organizations maintain visibility and control across increasingly complex, distributed systems.
