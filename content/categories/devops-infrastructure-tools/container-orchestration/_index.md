# Container & Orchestration

Containerization has revolutionized application deployment by solving the "it works on my machine" problem through consistent, portable environments. Orchestration platforms then manage these containers at scale with automated deployment and management.

## Container Benefits

- **Consistency**: Applications run identically across development, testing, and production environments
- **Portability**: Containers run on any platform that supports the container runtime
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight containers share the host OS kernel, using fewer resources than virtual machines
- **Scalability**: Rapid container startup enables elastic scaling based on demand
- **Isolation**: Applications are isolated from each other while sharing underlying resources

Modern orchestration platforms abstract away infrastructure complexity, enabling developers to focus on application logic while the platform handles scaling, networking, and service management automatically.
