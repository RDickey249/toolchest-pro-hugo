# Docker

Docker revolutionized application deployment by popularizing containerization technology that packages applications with their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. The platform's container runtime creates isolated environments that share the host operating system kernel, making them more efficient than traditional virtual machines. Docker's layered filesystem enables efficient storage and distribution of container images, while its registry system facilitates sharing and version control of containerized applications. The platform's simple command-line interface makes containerization accessible to developers, while Dockerfile specifications enable reproducible builds and infrastructure-as-code practices. Docker's networking capabilities allow containers to communicate securely while remaining isolated from the host system. The platform's volume system provides persistent storage options for stateful applications and data management. Docker Desktop provides local development environments that mirror production container deployments, ensuring consistency across development and deployment stages. The platform's extensive ecosystem includes Docker Hub for public image sharing, Docker Compose for multi-container applications, and Docker Swarm for basic orchestration. Docker's integration with CI/CD pipelines streamlines automated testing and deployment workflows. With support for multiple architectures and operating systems, Docker has become the de facto standard for containerization, enabling the microservices architectures and cloud-native applications that power modern software systems.
