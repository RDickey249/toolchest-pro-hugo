- **Layered filesystem** - Efficient storage and distribution of container images
- **Docker Hub** - Public registry for image sharing and version control
- **Simple CLI** - Accessible containerization for developers
- **Dockerfile** - Reproducible builds and infrastructure-as-code
- **Docker Desktop** - Local development mirroring production deployments
- **Extensive ecosystem** - Docker Compose, Swarm, and CI/CD integration

## Use Cases

- Application containerization and deployment
- Microservices architectures
- Local development environments
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- Cloud-native application development
