# LXC/LXD

LXC (Linux Containers) and LXD provide system containerization that creates lightweight virtual machines with near-native performance, ideal for running complete Linux distributions.

## Key Features

- **System containers** - Run complete Linux distributions with init systems
- **LXD hypervisor** - Advanced management with REST API and clustering
- **Resource controls** - CPU, memory, network, and I/O limits
- **Strong security** - User namespaces, AppArmor profiles, seccomp filters
- **Snapshots and backups** - Point-in-time recovery and container migration
- **Clustering support** - Distributed deployment with shared storage
- **Image management** - Pre-built Linux distribution images with updates

## Use Cases

- Lightweight virtualization for traditional applications
- Multi-service container deployments
- Development and testing environments
- Infrastructure services containerization
- Legacy application modernization

## Get Started with LXC/LXD
