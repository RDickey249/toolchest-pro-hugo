# LXC/LXD

LXC (Linux Containers) and LXD provide system containerization that creates lightweight virtual machines with near-native performance, offering an alternative to both application containers and traditional virtual machines. Unlike Docker's application containers, LXC containers run complete Linux distributions with their own init systems, making them ideal for multi-service applications and traditional server workloads. LXD serves as a hypervisor for LXC containers, providing advanced management capabilities, REST API access, and clustering support for enterprise deployments. The platform's resource controls include CPU, memory, network, and I/O limits that ensure fair resource allocation across containers. LXC/LXD's security model includes user namespaces, AppArmor profiles, and seccomp filters that provide strong isolation between containers and the host system. The platform's snapshot and backup capabilities enable point-in-time recovery and easy container migration between hosts. LXD's clustering features support distributed container deployment with shared storage and networking across multiple nodes. The platform's image management system provides pre-built images for popular Linux distributions with automatic updates and custom image creation capabilities. LXC/LXD's networking includes bridge networking, VLAN support, and integration with software-defined networking solutions. The platform's storage backends support ZFS, Btrfs, and LVM for advanced storage features like compression, deduplication, and thin provisioning. With its focus on system-level containerization and operational simplicity, LXC/LXD serves organizations needing lightweight virtualization for traditional applications and infrastructure services.
