# OpenShift

Red Hat OpenShift is an enterprise Kubernetes platform that adds developer-friendly tools, enhanced security, and operational capabilities to standard Kubernetes deployments. The platform provides a comprehensive application development and deployment environment with integrated CI/CD pipelines, source-to-image builds, and automated application scaling. OpenShift's developer console offers an intuitive web interface for managing applications, while its command-line tools provide advanced capabilities for power users. The platform's project-based multi-tenancy enables secure resource isolation and collaboration across development teams. OpenShift's integrated container registry provides secure image storage and vulnerability scanning, while its built-in monitoring and logging solutions offer comprehensive observability. The platform's operator framework simplifies the management of complex, stateful applications through automated lifecycle management. OpenShift's security-first approach includes security context constraints, network policies, and compliance scanning that meet enterprise security requirements. The platform's service mesh integration provides advanced traffic management, security, and observability for microservices architectures. OpenShift's hybrid and multi-cloud capabilities enable consistent application deployment across on-premises, public cloud, and edge environments. The platform's extensive ecosystem includes certified operators, integrated development tools, and enterprise support from Red Hat. With deployment options including self-managed, managed cloud services, and dedicated hosting, OpenShift provides enterprise-grade Kubernetes with the tools and support needed for production applications.
