# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is the open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, now the industry standard for production container orchestration.

## Key Features

- **Declarative configuration** - Specify desired states, Kubernetes maintains them
- **Service discovery** - Automatic load balancing across healthy container instances
- **Self-healing** - Restart failed containers and replace unhealthy nodes
- **Auto-scaling** - Horizontal scaling based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics
- **Rolling updates** - Zero-downtime deployments with easy rollback
- **Extensive ecosystem** - Helm, Istio, operators, and thousands of tools
- **Multi-cloud portability** - Run consistently across any cloud or on-premises

## Use Cases

- Production container orchestration
- Microservices architecture deployment
- Cloud-native application management
- Multi-cloud and hybrid deployments
- Enterprise-scale container operations
