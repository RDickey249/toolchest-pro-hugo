# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of machines. Originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Kubernetes has become the standard for container orchestration in production environments. The platform's declarative configuration model allows users to specify desired application states, while Kubernetes controllers continuously work to maintain those states. Kubernetes' service discovery and load balancing capabilities automatically distribute traffic across healthy container instances, while its self-healing features restart failed containers and replace unhealthy nodes. The platform's horizontal auto-scaling adjusts the number of container replicas based on CPU usage, memory consumption, or custom metrics. Kubernetes' rolling update mechanism enables zero-downtime deployments and easy rollback capabilities. The platform's extensive ecosystem includes Helm for package management, Istio for service mesh capabilities, and numerous operators for managing complex applications. Kubernetes' multi-cloud portability enables applications to run consistently across different cloud providers and on-premises environments. The platform's role-based access control and network policies provide comprehensive security features for enterprise deployments. With managed Kubernetes services available from all major cloud providers, Kubernetes combines the power of container orchestration with the convenience of managed infrastructure.
