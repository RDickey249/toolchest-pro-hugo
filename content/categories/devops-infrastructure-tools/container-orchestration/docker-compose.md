Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using simple YAML files that describe the entire application stack.

## Key Features

- **YAML configuration** - Define multi-container apps in single files
- **Service abstraction** - Easy scaling and load balancing of components
- **Environment management** - Variable support for different environments
- **Automatic networking** - Isolated networks with service name communication
- **Volume management** - Persistent storage and data sharing
- **Override files** - Environment-specific configs without duplication
- **Docker integration** - Compatible with Swarm and Kubernetes tools

## Use Cases

- Local development environments
- Multi-container application definition
- Development workflow automation
- Testing environment setup
- Simple container orchestration
