# Helm

Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters through reusable, configurable packages called charts. The platform's templating system enables parameterized Kubernetes manifests that can be customized for different environments and deployment scenarios. Helm's chart repository system facilitates sharing and versioning of application packages, while its dependency management handles complex applications with multiple components. The platform's release management capabilities track deployed applications, enable easy upgrades and rollbacks, and maintain deployment history. Helm's hooks system allows custom actions during installation, upgrade, and deletion phases, enabling complex deployment workflows and data migrations. The platform's values system provides flexible configuration management through YAML files, command-line overrides, and environment-specific settings. Helm's extensive public chart repository, Artifact Hub, offers thousands of pre-built charts for popular applications and services. The platform's security features include chart signing, provenance verification, and role-based access controls for chart repositories. Helm's integration with CI/CD pipelines automates application deployments and updates across multiple environments. The platform's testing capabilities enable validation of chart templates and deployed resources. With its focus on reusability, consistency, and operational efficiency, Helm has become essential for organizations deploying complex applications on Kubernetes at scale.
