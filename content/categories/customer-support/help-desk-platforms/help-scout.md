# Help Scout

Help Scout is a beautifully simple help desk platform that feels more like email than traditional ticketing software. Designed specifically for growing businesses that want to maintain a personal touch as they scale, Help Scout removes the complexity often associated with help desk systems. The platform's shared inbox approach allows teams to collaborate on customer conversations naturally, with features like private notes, @mentions, and collision detection preventing duplicate responses. Help Scout's Beacon widget provides in-app messaging, self-service docs, and proactive messages in one seamless experience. The platform includes robust reporting tools that track team performance, customer happiness, and support trends without requiring complex setup. With native mobile apps, custom fields, and workflow automation, Help Scout grows with your business while maintaining its signature simplicity. The platform's customer-centric design philosophy extends to pricing, with no per-agent limits on features, ensuring every team member has access to the tools they need to deliver exceptional support.
