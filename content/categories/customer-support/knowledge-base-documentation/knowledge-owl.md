# KnowledgeOwl

KnowledgeOwl is a flexible and feature-rich knowledge base platform that gives documentation teams complete control over their content and presentation. Designed by technical writers for technical writers, KnowledgeOwl provides advanced authoring tools including conditional content, variables, and snippets for maintaining consistent documentation across articles. The platform's unique reader groups feature allows creation of customized documentation experiences for different audience segments, showing or hiding content based on user permissions. KnowledgeOwl's powerful search includes contextual previews, search analytics, and the ability to boost specific articles in results. The platform supports multiple knowledge bases from a single account, each with independent branding, custom domains, and access controls. With features like article versioning, bulk operations, and broken link detection, KnowledgeOwl streamlines documentation maintenance for large content libraries. The platform's extensive customization options include full HTML/CSS control, custom scripts, and API access for deep integrations. Built-in tools like glossaries, content reuse, and PDF generation make KnowledgeOwl particularly valuable for organizations with complex documentation needs.
