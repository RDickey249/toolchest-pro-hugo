# GitBook

GitBook is a modern documentation platform that brings the power of Git to knowledge management, enabling technical teams to create, collaborate, and publish beautiful documentation. Originally popular among developers for its Git-based workflow, GitBook has evolved into a comprehensive platform that balances technical capabilities with user-friendly interfaces. The platform's bi-directional GitHub/GitLab synchronization allows teams to edit documentation through code repositories or GitBook's intuitive web editor, accommodating different workflow preferences. GitBook's powerful search functionality includes AI-powered semantic search that understands context and intent beyond keyword matching. The platform supports multiple content types including API references, runnable code blocks, and embedded content from various sources. With features like branching and merging for documentation versions, teams can manage documentation changes like code. GitBook's visitor authentication options include SSO, OAuth, and domain whitelisting for controlling access to sensitive documentation. The platform's clean, responsive design ensures documentation looks great on any device while customization options allow teams to maintain brand consistency. GitBook's integration ecosystem and API make it a flexible foundation for documentation workflows.
