# Confluence

Confluence by Atlassian is a comprehensive team collaboration and knowledge management platform that serves as a single source of truth for organizations. While often used for internal documentation, Confluence's powerful features make it an excellent choice for customer-facing knowledge bases as well. The platform's flexible page structure allows teams to create anything from simple how-to articles to complex technical documentation with embedded diagrams, spreadsheets, and multimedia content. Confluence's collaborative editing features enable multiple team members to work on documentation simultaneously with real-time updates and inline comments. The platform's powerful search functionality, enhanced by AI-powered recommendations, helps users quickly find relevant information across thousands of pages. With native integration with Jira and other Atlassian tools, Confluence creates a connected ecosystem where documentation stays synchronized with product development. The platform includes sophisticated permission controls, allowing organizations to manage access at space, page, or even paragraph level. Confluence's extensive marketplace offers hundreds of apps and integrations to extend functionality, from advanced diagramming tools to analytics and workflow automation.
