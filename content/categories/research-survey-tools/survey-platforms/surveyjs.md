SurveyJS is a comprehensive open-source JavaScript library that enables developers to add powerful survey functionality to their applications. Unlike hosted survey platforms, SurveyJS provides complete control over data, styling, and functionality while offering the flexibility to integrate surveys seamlessly into any web application. The library includes a visual survey builder that generates JSON definitions, making it easy for non-developers to create complex surveys without coding. SurveyJS supports all standard question types plus advanced features like matrix questions, dynamic panels, and custom widgets. The library's rendering engine works with popular frameworks including React, Angular, Vue.js, and jQuery, ensuring compatibility with modern web stacks. With features like conditional logic, validation, localization support for over 30 languages, and custom functions, SurveyJS handles complex survey requirements. The platform includes PDF export functionality and a separate analytics module for visualizing results. Being self-hosted, SurveyJS is ideal for organizations with strict data privacy requirements or those wanting to embed surveys deeply into their applications. The library's extensible architecture allows developers to create custom question types and integrate with any backend system.
