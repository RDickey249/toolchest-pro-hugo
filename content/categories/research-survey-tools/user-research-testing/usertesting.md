UserTesting is the leading human insight platform that enables organizations to understand their customers' experiences through real-time feedback and observation. The platform connects businesses with its global network of contributors who provide authentic feedback while interacting with websites, apps, prototypes, and even physical products. UserTesting's strength lies in capturing both what users do and why they do it through recorded sessions that include screen activity, facial expressions, and verbal commentary. The platform's AI-powered insights engine automatically identifies key moments, sentiments, and themes across sessions, dramatically reducing analysis time. With features like Live Conversation for moderated sessions, unmoderated task-based tests, and longitudinal studies, UserTesting supports diverse research methodologies. The platform includes templates for common research scenarios like competitive benchmarking, prototype validation, and journey mapping. UserTesting's machine learning capabilities provide instant insights including sentiment analysis, keyword identification, and automated highlight reels. With integrations to design tools, project management platforms, and analytics services, UserTesting fits seamlessly into product development workflows. The platform's enterprise features include unlimited seats, custom branding, and dedicated success management.
