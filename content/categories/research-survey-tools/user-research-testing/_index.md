# User Research & Testing

User research and testing tools are essential for creating products and experiences that truly resonate with users. These platforms enable teams to move beyond assumptions and base decisions on real user behavior and feedback.

## Testing Methods

- **Usability Testing**: Watch users interact with your product to identify confusion points and opportunities
- **Card Sorting**: Understand how users categorize and organize information for better navigation
- **Tree Testing**: Validate information architecture before investing in design and development
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different versions to determine which performs better with users
- **User Interviews**: Conduct moderated or unmoderated sessions to gather qualitative insights

Modern user research platforms make it easy to recruit participants, conduct tests remotely, and analyze results quickly, enabling continuous improvement based on user feedback throughout the development process.
