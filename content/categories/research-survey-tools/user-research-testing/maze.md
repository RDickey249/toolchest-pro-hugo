Maze is a rapid testing platform that enables product teams to collect user insights quickly and continuously throughout the design process. Purpose-built for modern product development, Maze allows teams to test everything from early concepts to live products without leaving their design tools. The platform's seamless integration with Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, and InVision means prototypes can be transformed into tests in minutes. Maze supports various research methods including prototype testing, card sorting, tree testing, surveys, and preference tests, providing flexibility for different research needs. The platform's AI-powered reporting automatically generates insights, success metrics, and usability scores, eliminating hours of manual analysis. With features like path analysis, heatmaps, and mission completion rates, teams get quantitative validation of design decisions. Maze's participant recruitment service provides access to targeted users, while integration with existing user bases enables testing with actual customers. The platform's collaborative features allow stakeholders to view results in real-time and leave comments on specific insights. With templates for common testing scenarios and the ability to run multiple tests simultaneously, Maze accelerates the iteration cycle. Its focus on actionable insights makes Maze ideal for teams practicing continuous discovery.
