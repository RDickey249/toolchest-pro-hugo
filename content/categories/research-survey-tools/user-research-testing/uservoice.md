UserVoice is a product feedback management platform that helps teams collect, analyze, and act on customer feedback to build better products. The platform creates a centralized system for gathering feature requests, bug reports, and general feedback from multiple channels including in-app widgets, support tickets, and sales conversations. UserVoice's smart suggestion system prevents duplicate requests and helps users find and vote on existing ideas, creating clear demand signals for product teams. The platform's analytics reveal which features different customer segments want most, enabling data-driven prioritization based on revenue impact and strategic value. UserVoice's roadmap planning tools help teams communicate what's planned, in progress, and recently shipped, closing the feedback loop with customers. The platform includes powerful segmentation capabilities to understand feedback patterns by customer type, plan level, or custom attributes. With native integrations to development tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, and Slack, UserVoice ensures customer insights flow into existing workflows. The platform's engagement tracking shows which customers are most engaged with product development, identifying potential advocates and beta testers. UserVoice transforms chaotic feature requests into organized, actionable product intelligence.
