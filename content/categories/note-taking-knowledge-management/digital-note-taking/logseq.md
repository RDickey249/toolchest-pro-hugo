# Logseq

Logseq revolutionizes privacy-focused note-taking through open-source knowledge graphs that enable users to maintain complete data control while building interconnected thought networks with proven effectiveness across privacy-conscious knowledge workers and researchers. This platform provides extensive features for outliner-based editing, bidirectional linking, task management, and PDF annotation while offering advanced capabilities like end-to-end encryption, custom queries, and plugin development. Logseq's strength lies in its local-first architecture and community-driven development, offering secure note-taking that works entirely offline with optional sync through Git and proven commitment to user privacy and data sovereignty. The platform excels at serving researchers, students, and professionals requiring private knowledge management with features like flashcards, namespaces, and property graphs that enable everything from academic research to personal journaling with Markdown/Org-mode support, block references, and extensible architecture while providing users with cross-platform applications, transparent development, and proven alternative to cloud-based solutions without sacrificing modern features.
