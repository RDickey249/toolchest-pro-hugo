## How It Compares

Adobe Firefly prioritizes professional integration and ethical AI over the artistic freedom of Midjourney or the open-source flexibility of Stable Diffusion. While DALL·E and Canva target broader audiences, Firefly focuses on creative professionals already using Adobe tools. Unlike Runway's video emphasis or Microsoft Designer's template approach, Firefly enhances existing creative workflows. Its commercial safety surpasses most competitors, though it may produce less adventurous results than Midjourney. For professionals requiring AI tools that integrate with industry-standard software and provide legal clarity for commercial use, Firefly offers unmatched value within the Adobe ecosystem.
