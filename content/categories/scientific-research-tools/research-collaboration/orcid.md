ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier for researchers that distinguishes them from other researchers and connects them with their research activities and outputs across their entire career. As a non-profit organization, ORCID addresses the name ambiguity problem in scholarly communication by providing each researcher with a unique 16-digit identifier that remains constant throughout their career.

The system serves as a hub that connects researchers with their professional activities, ensuring proper attribution of research outputs regardless of name changes, institutional affiliations, or career transitions.

## What Makes ORCID Different

ORCID's persistent identification approach includes:
- Unique 16-digit identifier that remains constant throughout a researcher's career
- Integration with major publishers, funding agencies, and institutional systems
- Comprehensive profile that aggregates all research activities and outputs
- Privacy controls that allow researchers to manage the visibility of their information
- Automated data integration from trusted sources like CrossRef and institutional repositories
- Non-profit governance that ensures researcher interests remain the priority

Researchers and academic institutions choose ORCID when they need a reliable way to ensure proper attribution of research outputs and streamline the administrative burden of maintaining accurate researcher profiles across multiple systems.
