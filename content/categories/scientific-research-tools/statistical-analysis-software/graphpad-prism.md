GraphPad Prism is specialized statistical software designed specifically for biologists and researchers in life sciences. Unlike general-purpose statistical software, Prism focuses on the statistical analyses most commonly used in biological research, combining ease of use with publication-quality graphing capabilities.

The software streamlines the workflow from data entry through analysis to publication, offering templates and guided analysis choices that help researchers select appropriate statistical tests. Its strength lies in making complex biostatistical analyses accessible to scientists who may not have extensive statistical training.

## What Makes GraphPad Prism Different

Prism's biology-focused approach includes:
- Pre-configured analysis templates for common biological experiments
- Guided statistical test selection based on experimental design
- Seamless integration of statistical analysis with publication-quality graphing
- Specialized analyses for dose-response curves, survival analysis, and assay validation
- Built-in guidance for interpreting statistical results in biological context

Life science researchers choose Prism because it combines the statistical rigor needed for publication with an interface designed specifically for biological research workflows.
