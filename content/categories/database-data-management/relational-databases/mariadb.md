# MariaDB

MariaDB is an enhanced, drop-in replacement for MySQL created by MySQL's original developers after Oracle's acquisition of MySQL. This open-source database maintains full compatibility with MySQL while adding advanced features, improved performance, and ensuring continued open-source development. MariaDB includes multiple storage engines beyond MySQL's offerings, such as ColumnStore for analytics workloads and Spider for sharding across multiple servers. The database's query optimizer has been significantly enhanced with features like subquery optimization, join optimization, and better index usage that often result in faster query execution than MySQL. MariaDB's Galera Cluster provides synchronous multi-master replication with automatic node provisioning and data consistency guarantees. The platform includes advanced security features like data-at-rest encryption, user account validation, and role-based access control that enhance MySQL's basic security model. MariaDB's compatibility with MySQL makes migration straightforward while providing access to newer features like common table expressions, window functions, and temporal tables. The database's MaxScale proxy provides intelligent routing, load balancing, and high availability features for complex deployments. With backing from the MariaDB Foundation and strong enterprise support options, MariaDB offers a truly open-source alternative to MySQL with guaranteed continued development and enhanced capabilities for modern applications.
