# SQLite

SQLite is a lightweight, embedded relational database that runs entirely within applications without requiring a separate server process, making it perfect for mobile apps, desktop software, and small to medium-sized websites. Despite its small footprint, SQLite is a fully-featured SQL database that supports most standard SQL features, including transactions, triggers, and views. The database is self-contained in a single file, making deployment and backup incredibly simple while eliminating installation and configuration complexities. SQLite's ACID compliance ensures data integrity even in challenging environments like mobile devices or embedded systems where power loss is common. The database's exceptional reliability stems from extensive testing, with millions of test cases ensuring stability across different platforms and scenarios. SQLite's cross-platform compatibility means applications work identically on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android without modification. The database's public domain licensing eliminates legal complexities and costs, making it freely usable in any project. SQLite's performance characteristics favor read-heavy workloads and smaller datasets, while its write serialization ensures consistency but may limit concurrent write scalability. With billions of deployments worldwide and usage in countless applications from web browsers to smart TVs, SQLite has proven its value as the most widely deployed database engine in the world.
