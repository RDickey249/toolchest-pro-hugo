Snowflake is the cloud data platform that's built for the cloud from the ground up. Unlike traditional data warehouses that were retrofitted for the cloud, Snowflake separates compute from storage, enabling instant scaling and pay-per-use pricing.

Used by companies like Capital One, Adobe, and DoorDash, Snowflake has become the data platform of choice for organizations that need to scale their analytics without the complexity of traditional database management.

## Key Features
- **Elastic Scaling**: Scale compute up or down in seconds without downtime
- **Secure Data Sharing**: Share live data across organizations without copying
- **Multi-Cloud**: Deploy on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud with identical features
- **Time Travel**: Query historical data from any point in the past 90 days
- **Zero-Copy Cloning**: Create instant database copies without storage costs
- **Automatic Optimization**: Self-tuning performance without manual intervention

## Why Data Teams Choose Snowflake
Snowflake eliminates the traditional trade-offs between performance, scalability, and cost. Teams can run massive queries during peak times and scale down to zero when not in use. The platform handles all the database administration tasks, letting data teams focus on analytics instead of infrastructure.
