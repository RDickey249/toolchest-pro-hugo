Hadoop provides the foundational infrastructure for big data storage and processing, enabling organizations to manage petabyte-scale datasets across clusters of commodity hardware. Its distributed architecture ensures data reliability through automatic replication and fault tolerance.

The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) stores massive datasets across multiple nodes, while YARN manages cluster resources and job scheduling. The extensive ecosystem includes tools for every aspect of big data processing, from ingestion to analytics.

Key benefits include linear scalability, cost-effective storage on standard hardware, and proven reliability for mission-critical data workloads. The platform handles hardware failures gracefully, ensuring data availability even when individual nodes fail.

Hadoop excels for organizations with massive data storage requirements and complex batch processing needs. It serves as the backbone for data lakes and enterprise analytics infrastructure, particularly where cost-effective storage of diverse data types is essential.
