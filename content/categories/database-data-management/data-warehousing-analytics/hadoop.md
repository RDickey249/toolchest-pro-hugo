Apache Hadoop is a foundational framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware, pioneering the big data revolution in enterprise computing. Hadoop's core components include HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for reliable, scalable storage, and MapReduce for parallel processing of large datasets. The platform's fault-tolerant design replicates data across multiple nodes and automatically handles hardware failures without data loss or service interruption. Hadoop's ecosystem has evolved to include YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) for cluster resource management, enabling multiple processing engines beyond MapReduce. The platform supports diverse workloads through ecosystem tools like Hive for SQL-like queries, Pig for data flow scripting, HBase for NoSQL storage, and Spark for in-memory processing. Hadoop's batch-oriented processing model excels at ETL operations, log analysis, and historical data processing where latency is less critical than throughput. The platform's cost-effectiveness comes from utilizing commodity hardware and open-source software, making big data processing accessible to organizations of all sizes. Hadoop's linear scalability allows clusters to grow from a few nodes to thousands, handling petabytes of data with predictable performance characteristics. While newer platforms offer better performance for certain use cases, Hadoop remains essential for large-scale data storage, batch processing, and as a foundation for modern data lake architectures.
