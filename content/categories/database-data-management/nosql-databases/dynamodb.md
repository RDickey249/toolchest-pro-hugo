Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability, making it a cornerstone of modern serverless and microservices architectures. The database handles all infrastructure management, including provisioning, patching, and scaling, while delivering single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. DynamoDB's key-value and document data models support flexible schemas that adapt to changing application requirements without downtime. The service's on-demand billing model charges only for consumed read and write capacity, while provisioned capacity mode offers predictable performance at lower costs for steady workloads. DynamoDB's global tables provide multi-region, multi-master replication with eventual consistency, enabling globally distributed applications with local access patterns. The platform's DynamoDB Streams capture data changes in real-time, enabling event-driven architectures and data synchronization workflows. DynamoDB's integration with AWS Lambda creates powerful serverless architectures, while connections to other AWS services like API Gateway and AppSync streamline application development. The database's point-in-time recovery and on-demand backup capabilities protect against data loss, while fine-grained access control through IAM ensures security. With features like transactions, global secondary indexes, and DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for microsecond latency, DynamoDB provides enterprise-grade capabilities for applications requiring high performance and unlimited scale.
