# Apache NiFi

Apache NiFi is the open-source data integration platform that lets you design complex data flows using a visual, drag-and-drop interface. Route, transform, and process data from any source to any destination without writing code.

Used by Fortune 500 companies and government agencies, NiFi handles everything from IoT sensor data to enterprise system integration. Build data pipelines visually, monitor flows in real-time, and scale processing as your data grows with built-in clustering and load balancing.
