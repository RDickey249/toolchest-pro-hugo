# Prefect

Prefect is the modern workflow orchestration platform that makes data pipelines reliable, observable, and enjoyable to build. With its Python-first approach and intelligent state management, it's the workflow engine that data engineers actually want to use.

Built by the creators of the original Airflow concept, Prefect fixes everything that's frustrating about traditional workflow tools. It handles failures gracefully, provides rich observability, and scales from local development to enterprise deployments.

## Key Features
- **Python-Native**: Build workflows with pure Python - no YAML or XML required
- **Hybrid Execution**: Run workflows locally, in the cloud, or hybrid environments
- **Intelligent Retries**: Automatic failure recovery with exponential backoff
- **Rich Observability**: Real-time monitoring with detailed execution logs
- **Caching**: Skip expensive computations when inputs haven't changed
- **Dynamic Flows**: Workflows that adapt based on runtime conditions

## Why Data Teams Choose Prefect
Prefect eliminates the pain points of traditional orchestrators. Instead of brittle DAGs that fail catastrophically, Prefect workflows self-heal and provide clear visibility into what went wrong when issues occur. The developer experience is so good that teams actually enjoy building data pipelines.
