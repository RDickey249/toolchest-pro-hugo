Notion is the all-in-one workspace that combines notes, documents, databases, and project management in a single platform. Build custom workflows with blocks that connect together like digital Lego pieces.

Used by companies like Nike, Pixar, and Uber, Notion replaces dozens of separate tools with one flexible workspace. Create databases, write documentation, manage projects, and collaborate with your team using a modular system that adapts to any workflow.
