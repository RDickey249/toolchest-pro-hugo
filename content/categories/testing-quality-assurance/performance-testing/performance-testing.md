Performance testing validates application behavior under various load conditions to ensure systems meet performance requirements and provide acceptable user experiences.

## Key Features

- **Load testing** - Validate application capacity under normal usage
- **Stress testing** - Find breaking points and system limits
- **Spike testing** - Validate auto-scaling capabilities
- **Endurance testing** - Test long-term stability and memory leaks
- **Volume testing** - Test large amounts of data processing
- **CI/CD integration** - Catch performance regressions early
- **Real-time monitoring** - Track system behavior during tests

## Use Cases

- Application performance validation
- System capacity planning
- Performance regression testing
- Scalability assessment
- User experience optimization
