# REST Assured

REST Assured is a popular Java library that simplifies testing of REST services through a fluent, domain-specific language that makes API testing code readable and maintainable. The library's builder pattern allows chaining method calls to construct requests and validations in an intuitive, English-like syntax. REST Assured's comprehensive assertion capabilities enable validation of response status codes, headers, body content, and JSON/XML structures with powerful matchers. The library's authentication support includes basic auth, OAuth, form authentication, and custom authentication schemes for secure API testing. REST Assured's request specification feature enables creating reusable request templates with common headers, parameters, and configuration. The library's response extraction capabilities allow capturing values from responses for use in subsequent requests or assertions. REST Assured's JSON and XML path support provides powerful querying capabilities for complex response structures. The library's integration with popular testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG enables seamless incorporation into existing test suites. REST Assured's logging features provide detailed request and response information for debugging and troubleshooting. The library's multipart form data support enables testing of file upload and complex form submissions. With its focus on readability and Java ecosystem integration, REST Assured has become the standard for REST API testing in Java-based applications and enterprise environments.
