# Thunder Client

Thunder Client is a lightweight REST API client extension for Visual Studio Code that brings API testing capabilities directly into the popular code editor. The extension's minimalist design focuses on essential API testing features without the complexity of standalone applications. Thunder Client's collection system organizes API requests with folder structures and enables easy sharing through Git repositories alongside project code. The extension's environment management allows switching between different API configurations with variable substitution and dynamic values. Thunder Client's testing capabilities include pre-request scripts and response assertions using JavaScript for automated API validation. The extension's import functionality supports Postman collections, enabling easy migration from other API testing tools. Thunder Client's response visualization includes JSON formatting, XML parsing, and response time tracking with clean, readable output. The extension's GUI and text-based modes provide flexibility for different workflow preferences and use cases. Thunder Client's Git-friendly approach stores collections in JSON files that can be version controlled with project code. The extension's performance optimizations ensure fast startup and responsive operation within VS Code. Thunder Client's CLI runner enables command-line execution of collections for CI/CD integration. With its focus on simplicity and VS Code integration, Thunder Client provides an efficient API testing solution for developers who prefer working within their code editor environment.
