- **Nested groups** - Organize tests with describe, context, and it blocks
- **Mocking and stubbing** - Isolate dependencies for focused testing
- **Rails integration** - Specialized helpers for web application testing
- **Flexible filtering** - Run specific tests using tags and metadata
- **Documentation output** - Generate living specifications from tests

## Use Cases
