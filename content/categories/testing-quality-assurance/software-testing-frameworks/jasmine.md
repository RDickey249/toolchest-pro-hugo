# Jasmine

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for JavaScript that provides everything needed to test JavaScript code without dependencies on other frameworks or DOM. The framework's clean, readable syntax uses describe and it blocks to create expressive test specifications that serve as both tests and documentation. Jasmine's built-in assertion library includes a comprehensive set of matchers for common testing scenarios, with the ability to create custom matchers for specific needs. The framework's spy system enables function mocking, call tracking, and return value stubbing without external dependencies. Jasmine's asynchronous testing support handles callbacks, promises, and timeouts gracefully, making it suitable for modern JavaScript applications. The framework's setup and teardown functions (beforeEach, afterEach, beforeAll, afterAll) provide flexible test preparation and cleanup. Jasmine's clock mocking capabilities enable testing of time-dependent code by controlling JavaScript's timing functions. The framework's focused and excluded test execution allows running specific tests or test suites during development. Jasmine's browser and Node.js compatibility enables testing across different JavaScript environments with consistent behavior. The framework's HTML runner provides a visual interface for browser-based test execution and debugging. With its batteries-included approach and focus on readability, Jasmine provides a complete testing solution that has influenced many other JavaScript testing frameworks and BDD practices.
