Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks or DOM, making it ideal for websites, Node.js projects, or anywhere JavaScript runs.

## Key Features

- **BDD syntax** with describe/it blocks for readable tests
- **Built-in assertions** with comprehensive matchers
- **Spy system** for mocking and stubbing functions
- **Async support** for callbacks, promises, and timeouts
- **Clock mocking** for time-dependent code testing
- **No dependencies** - works standalone
- **Cross-platform** - runs in browsers and Node.js

## Use Cases

- Unit testing JavaScript applications
- Behavior-driven development
- DOM-independent testing
- Node.js testing
- Legacy JavaScript testing
