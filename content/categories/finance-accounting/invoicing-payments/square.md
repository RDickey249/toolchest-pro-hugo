# Square

Square is a comprehensive payment processing platform that enables businesses to accept credit cards, contactless payments, and online transactions. It combines point-of-sale hardware with integrated business management tools including inventory tracking, sales analytics, and team management.

What sets Square apart is its seamless integration between in-person and online payments with built-in business tools. Unlike standalone payment processors, Square includes inventory management, customer relationship features, marketing tools, and detailed analytics in one unified system.

It's ideal for small to medium-sized retailers, restaurants, and service businesses that need both payment processing and business management capabilities. Square works best for businesses that want an all-in-one solution rather than managing separate systems for payments, inventory, and customer data.
