# Quizgecko

Quizgecko transforms learning assessment by using AI to automatically generate engaging quizzes, flashcards, and study materials from any content source, enabling educators and students to create comprehensive review materials that reinforce learning and identify knowledge gaps without the time-consuming process of manual question creation.
