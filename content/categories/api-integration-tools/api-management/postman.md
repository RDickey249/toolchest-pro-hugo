## How It Compares

Postman dominates the API development space with its comprehensive feature set and user-friendly interface, far exceeding basic tools like curl or HTTPie. While Insomnia offers a cleaner interface for simple requests and Thunder Client provides VS Code integration, Postman's ecosystem approach sets it apart. Unlike specialized tools like SoapUI for SOAP APIs or Paw's Mac-focused design, Postman excels across all API types and platforms. Its team collaboration features surpass alternatives like RapidAPI or Hoppscotch, while the automated testing capabilities rival dedicated tools. Though newer entrants focus on specific niches, Postman's combination of individual productivity and enterprise collaboration makes it the de facto standard for API development workflows.
