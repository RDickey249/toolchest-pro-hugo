The platform supports various devices including desktop, mobile, and tablet testing, with dedicated apps ensuring high-quality recordings. Lookback's collaborative features shine during analysis, with timestamped notes, highlight reels, and team workspaces for synthesizing insights. The platform includes powerful participant management tools for recruiting, scheduling, and incentive distribution. With features like automatic transcription, sentiment analysis, and searchable sessions, Lookback reduces the time from research to insights. The platform's SDK enables in-app research for mobile applications, capturing real usage contexts. Integration with tools like Slack, Calendly, and various research repositories creates efficient research workflows. Lookback's focus on research operations makes it ideal for teams conducting frequent user research at scale.
