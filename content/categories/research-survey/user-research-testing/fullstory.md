# FullStory

FullStory is a digital experience intelligence platform that captures and analyzes every user interaction to help businesses perfect their digital experiences. Unlike traditional analytics that rely on predefined events, FullStory's tagless autocapture records everything users do, enabling retroactive analysis of any behavior without prior instrumentation. The platform's powerful search engine allows teams to find sessions based on any combination of user actions, properties, and outcomes, making it easy to investigate specific issues or patterns. FullStory's frustration signals automatically identify rage clicks, dead clicks, error messages, and broken elements that impact user experience. The platform includes advanced features like conversion funnels, user journey mapping, and segment analysis that reveal optimization opportunities. With OmniSearch, teams can search for any text users see or interact with, making content-based analysis possible. FullStory's privacy-first approach includes automatic PII exclusion, data residency options, and granular privacy controls. The platform's machine learning capabilities surface insights automatically, highlighting unusual patterns and emerging issues. Integration with popular tools like Slack, Jira, and Segment enables workflow automation and deeper analysis. FullStory serves product, engineering, and support teams seeking to understand and improve digital experiences.
