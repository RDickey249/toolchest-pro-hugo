# Hotjar

Hotjar is a behavior analytics and user feedback platform that helps businesses understand how users interact with their websites through visual insights. The platform combines multiple research tools including heatmaps, session recordings, feedback widgets, and surveys to provide a complete picture of user behavior and sentiment. Hotjar's heatmaps visualize where users click, scroll, and move their cursors, revealing patterns that traditional analytics miss. Session recordings show individual user journeys, helping identify usability issues, bugs, and conversion barriers in real-time context. The platform's feedback tools include on-site polls, feedback widgets, and targeted surveys that capture user voice at critical moments. Hotjar's funnel analysis shows where users drop off in conversion processes, while form analytics reveals which fields cause abandonment. The platform's rage click detection and u-turn identification automatically surface frustration signals. With privacy-first design including automatic data anonymization and GDPR compliance, Hotjar respects user privacy while providing valuable insights. The platform's ease of implementation via simple JavaScript snippet and intuitive interface makes professional user research accessible to teams without dedicated researchers. Hotjar's affordable pricing and generous free tier democratize access to user behavior insights.
