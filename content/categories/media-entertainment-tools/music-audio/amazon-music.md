# Amazon Music

Amazon Music is Amazon's comprehensive music streaming platform that offers multiple tiers of service, from the included Prime Music for Amazon Prime members to the full-featured Amazon Music Unlimited. The service provides access to over 100 million songs with high-definition and ultra-high-definition audio options for audiophiles. Amazon Music's deep integration with Alexa enables hands-free voice control, making it particularly powerful on Echo devices and throughout Amazon's smart home ecosystem. The platform's X-Ray feature provides detailed information about songs, artists, and lyrics, similar to the feature found in Amazon Prime Video. Amazon Music Unlimited includes exclusive releases, live performances, and original content, while also offering 360 Reality Audio for immersive listening experiences. The service's family plan allows up to six family members to have individual accounts with personalized recommendations. With offline downloads, cross-device synchronization, and integration with Amazon's broader ecosystem of services, Amazon Music appeals particularly to existing Amazon customers and smart home enthusiasts.
