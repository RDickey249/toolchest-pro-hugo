# OBS Studio

OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source application that has become the gold standard for live streaming and screen recording across all platforms. Despite being completely free, OBS offers professional-grade features that rival expensive commercial broadcasting software, including unlimited scenes, sources, and customizable transitions. The software's scene-based approach allows streamers to create complex layouts with multiple video sources, images, text overlays, and real-time effects that can be switched instantly during broadcasts. OBS's powerful audio mixing capabilities include real-time noise suppression, gain control, and filters that ensure broadcast-quality sound. The platform supports streaming to virtually any service that accepts RTMP, including Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Live, and custom streaming servers, while simultaneously recording locally in high quality. OBS's extensive plugin ecosystem adds functionality like chat integration, stream deck support, and advanced video effects created by the community. The software's low system resource usage and optimized encoding ensure smooth streaming even on modest hardware configurations. OBS's cross-platform compatibility runs identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible regardless of operating system. Regular updates and active community support ensure OBS stays current with new streaming technologies and platform requirements, making it an essential tool for content creators worldwide.
