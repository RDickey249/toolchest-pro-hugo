# Wirecast

Wirecast is professional live streaming and production software designed for high-end broadcasts, corporate events, and multi-camera productions that require television-quality output. The platform supports unlimited input sources including cameras, microphones, computer desktops, web feeds, and media files, making it suitable for complex production environments. Wirecast's advanced switching capabilities allow real-time cutting between sources with professional transitions, titles, and graphics that rival traditional broadcast equipment. The software's built-in graphics package includes lower thirds, title cards, and customizable templates that provide polished, professional presentations. Wirecast's audio mixing console offers comprehensive control over multiple audio sources with EQ, compressor, and limiter effects that ensure broadcast-quality sound. The platform's streaming capabilities support multiple simultaneous destinations, allowing broadcasters to reach audiences across various platforms simultaneously. Wirecast's recording features can capture isolated sources, program output, and multiple formats simultaneously for post-production and archival purposes. The software's integration with hardware switchers, teleprompters, and external graphics systems makes it scalable for productions of any size. Wirecast's NewTek NDI support enables network-based video production workflows that reduce cable complexity in multi-camera setups. With features like virtual sets, chromakey, and 3D graphics, Wirecast provides the tools necessary for professional-grade live video production that meets broadcast television standards.
