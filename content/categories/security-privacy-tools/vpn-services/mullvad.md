# Mullvad

Mullvad is the VPN service that takes privacy seriously - no email, no phone number, no personal information required. You get an account number, that's it. This Swedish VPN provider is built for people who want true anonymity online.

Unlike commercial VPNs that collect your data for marketing, Mullvad's business model is simple: pay â‚¬5/month, get complete privacy. They even accept cash payments by mail to ensure maximum anonymity.

## Key Features
- **Anonymous Accounts**: No email or personal info - just an account number
- **Open Source**: All apps are open source and independently audited
- **WireGuard Protocol**: Modern, fast VPN protocol with strong encryption
- **Multi-hop**: Route through multiple servers for extra security
- **Own Infrastructure**: Mullvad owns and controls their server hardware
- **Cash Payments**: Mail cash for ultimate payment anonymity

## Why Privacy Advocates Choose Mullvad
Mullvad was built by privacy advocates for privacy advocates. They don't track users, don't store logs, and operate under Swedish privacy laws. The company has been subjected to police raids and proven they have no data to hand over - the ultimate privacy test.
