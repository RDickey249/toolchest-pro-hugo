Meyer Scale is a cultural dimensions framework based on Erin Meyer's research that analyzes cultural differences across eight key dimensions affecting international business communication and collaboration. The framework provides a practical tool for understanding how cultures differ in areas such as communication style, feedback delivery, decision-making, and trust-building approaches.

The service translates academic cultural research into practical business applications, helping international managers and global teams navigate cultural differences more effectively in professional contexts.
