## How It Compares

Backblaze revolutionizes personal backup with true unlimited storage at an unmatched price point, while competitors like Carbonite and IDrive impose storage limits or charge premium rates. Unlike complex solutions like Acronis True Image that require technical knowledge, Backblaze offers set-and-forget simplicity that even non-technical users can master. While pCloud and SpiderOak provide sync and privacy features, Backblaze focuses purely on comprehensive backup without the complexity. Its transparent pricing model contrasts sharply with the tiered restrictions of services like CrashPlan for Small Business. Although Time Machine offers free Mac backup, it lacks offsite protection, and while Google Drive provides cloud storage, it's not designed for full computer backup. Backblaze's combination of unlimited storage, automatic operation, and honest pricing makes it the clear choice for personal backup.
